2. **Sort processes by memory usage:**
   - **Answer:** `-%mem`
   - **Explanation:** Using `ps aux --sort=-%mem | head -10` sorts the processes by memory usage in descending order, quickly identifying the highest memory-consuming processes.

3. **High CPU incident command sequence:**
   - **Answer:** Identify using `top` or `htop`, then terminate with `kill` or force terminate with `kill -9 PID`.
   - **Explanation:** Real-time monitoring tools (`top`/`htop`) rapidly identify resource-intensive processes. Initial graceful termination (`kill PID`) is preferred; forceful termination (`kill -9 PID`) is used if the process does not respond.
