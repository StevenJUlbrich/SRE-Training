## 📚 Core Concepts

### 1. Network Diagnostics

- **Beginner Analogy**: Think of a phone line. If you can’t call someone, you first check if the phone is working.
- **Technical Explanation**: Tools like `ping` and `mtr` help confirm whether a host is reachable, measure latency, and identify packet loss.
- **SRE Application**: Quick detection of unreachable services or slow network links.
- **System Impact**: Minimal overhead, but essential for isolating root causes of failures.

### 2. Network Configuration

- **Beginner Analogy**: Like setting up your home Wi-Fi: each device needs an address, gateway, and DNS.
- **Technical Explanation**: Tools like `ifconfig` or `ip` manage IP addresses, netmasks, gateways, and routes.
- **SRE Application**: Ensuring correct interface settings is critical for multi-homed or containerized environments.
- **System Impact**: Incorrect settings can isolate services, while correct usage maintains connectivity.

### 3. Connection Monitoring

- **Beginner Analogy**: Checking who’s on the phone line right now.
- **Technical Explanation**: `netstat` and `ss` list current sockets, listening ports, and traffic stats.
- **SRE Application**: Pinpoint which services are active, confirm port usage, and detect unauthorized listening processes.
- **System Impact**: Viewing connections is low impact, but scanning can be somewhat resource-intensive.

### 4. Remote Access

- **Beginner Analogy**: Using a secure “tunnel” to visit a friend’s house.
- **Technical Explanation**: `ssh` provides encrypted remote logins, and `scp` transfers files securely over SSH.
- **SRE Application**: Quick remote administration of servers without physically being onsite.
- **System Impact**: Must handle authentication, key management, and port security.

## 🛠️ System Effects

1. **Filesystem and Metadata**: Commands like `ip` or `ping` do not directly write to disk. However, scp writes files to remote systems, which can fill up partitions if not monitored.
2. **System Resources**: `ping` and `netstat/ss` are low overhead, but frequent or large-file scp transfers can spike CPU (encryption) and I/O.
3. **Security Implications**: Opening or misconfiguring interfaces exposes surfaces for attacks. Using scp or ssh requires secure key management.
4. **Monitoring Visibility**: Log connection attempts (ssh) or netstat usage. Tools like tcpdump or system logs help track network events.

## 🚧 Troubleshooting

Below are three realistic scenarios with symptoms, causes, diagnosis, and resolutions:

1. **Scenario**: Unable to `ping` or `ssh` a newly provisioned server
   - **Symptoms**: `ping` times out, `ssh` says `No route to host`.
   - **Likely Causes**: Firewall rules not updated, server network config incomplete.
   - **Diagnosis**: Run `ip addr` or `ifconfig` on the server console, check if IP assigned; verify security group or firewall.
   - **Resolution**: Configure correct IP and subnet, open port 22. Confirm with `ping` again.
   - **Prevention**: Standardize provisioning scripts to apply identical firewall rules.

2. **Scenario**: Service on port 80 spontaneously unreachable
   - **Symptoms**: Web clients get connection refused.
   - **Likely Causes**: Another process took port 80, or the service crashed.
   - **Diagnosis**: Use `ss -tlnp | grep :80` to see if any process is listening.
   - **Resolution**: Restart the correct service or free the port from the rogue process.
   - **Prevention**: Monitoring system that triggers alerts on port changes.

3. **Scenario**: Slow file transfers with `scp` over a VPN
   - **Symptoms**: Transfers take excessively long.
   - **Likely Causes**: Encryption overhead, congested or high-latency VPN link.
   - **Diagnosis**: Compare local speed, check CPU usage for encryption overhead, measure packet loss.
   - **Resolution**: Switch to `rsync` with compression or tune SSH ciphers.
   - **Prevention**: Maintain adequate bandwidth, use performance-optimized ciphers.

## ❓ FAQ (3 per tier)

### Beginner FAQ

1. **Q**: “Why can’t I ping some servers even though they’re online?”
   **A**: Some networks or firewalls block ICMP echo requests for security.

2. **Q**: “Which is better: `ifconfig` or `ip`?”
   **A**: `ip` is more modern; `ifconfig` is older. Both achieve similar results, but `ip` has more features.

3. **Q**: “Do I need sudo for netstat or ss?”
   **A**: You can run them without sudo, but you might not see processes owned by other users.

### Intermediate FAQ

1. **Q**: “How do I store SSH passphrases so I’m not prompted every time?”
   **A**: Use `ssh-agent` and `ssh-add`. This caches your passphrase in memory.

2. **Q**: “Why does my route vanish after a reboot?”
   **A**: Changes made with `ip route` are not persistent by default. Update your distro’s networking config or use netplan.

3. **Q**: “How can I see whether connections are IPv4 or IPv6?”
   **A**: Tools like `ss -tlnp` typically list them separately. Look for `0.0.0.0` (IPv4) vs. `::` (IPv6).

### SRE-Level FAQ

1. **Q**: “What’s the best way to handle 100+ servers requiring the same SSH key updates?”
   **A**: Use config management or orchestration (e.g., Ansible, Chef) to push keys across systems.

2. **Q**: “Why might netstat or ss show multiple TIME_WAIT sockets for the same port?”
   **A**: This is common in high-traffic environments. TCP connections remain in TIME_WAIT briefly after closing.

3. **Q**: “When do I switch from scp to advanced solutions for file transfer?”
   **A**: If you need partial sync, checksums, or big scale. `rsync` is good for large or repeated sync; specialized tools help beyond that.

## 🔥 SRE Scenario

**Detailed Incident**: Microservice chain meltdown due to partial network outage.

**Situation**: A microservice-based application has 5 services. Users report sporadic 5xx errors in production. Suspect networking issues.

**Steps to Investigate**:

1. **Check Basic Host Connectivity**
   - `ping -c 2 serviceA` to confirm the main entry service is alive.
   - SRE Principle: Eliminate the simplest cause (host down) first.

2. **List Listening Ports**
   - `ss -tlnp | grep serviceA` to ensure it’s still bound to the correct port.
   - SRE Principle: Validate microservice is actually listening.

3. **Trace Path**
   - `mtr -n -r serviceB` from serviceA’s host to check if routing issues exist between them.
   - SRE Principle: End-to-end connectivity among microservices.

4. **Review Logs**
   - Pull logs from each service using `scp` or a log aggregator.
   - SRE Principle: Observability is key for distributed diagnostics.

5. **Attempt SSH Tunnels**
   - If direct connections fail, set up `ssh -L` to force traffic via a known good path.
   - SRE Principle: Quick workaround while diagnosing.

6. **Validate Database Access**
   - Possibly the database is unreachable for one of the services. `nc -zv dbhost 5432`.
   - SRE Principle: Check each dependency chain.

7. **Document Findings**
   - Summarize partial outage cause, e.g., a VLAN misconfiguration.
   - SRE Principle: Post-incident review to prevent recurrence.
