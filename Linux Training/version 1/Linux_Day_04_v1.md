# 🚀 **Day 4: Text Processing & Searching – grep, find, Pipes & Redirection**

---

## 📌 **Introduction**

### 🔄 **Recap of Day 3:**

Yesterday, you learned how to manage file permissions (`chmod`), file ownership (`chown`, `chgrp`), and administrative tasks (`sudo`). These skills enable secure and efficient resource management in Linux.

### 📅 **Today's Topics and Importance:**

Today, you'll dive into powerful Linux tools for text processing and searching: **`grep`**, **`find`**, **pipes (`|`)**, and **redirection (`>`, `>>`, `<`)**. These tools dramatically boost your ability to handle data, find information, and automate tasks on Linux systems.

### 🎯 **Learning Objectives:**

By the end of Day 4, you will be able to:

- Use `grep` to search for patterns within files.
- Find files and directories effectively using `find`.
- Combine commands effectively using pipes (`|`).
- Redirect command output and input using `>`, `>>`, and `<`.

## 📚 **Core Concepts Explained**

- **grep:** Stands for "Global Regular Expression Print". It’s like using the search function in a document, quickly locating lines matching specific text patterns or strings.

- **find:** A powerful command to locate files or directories matching specific criteria, similar to a "search engine" for your filesystem.

- **Pipes (`|`):** Allow combining commands, sending the output of one command directly as input to another, creating powerful, chained operations.

- **Redirection (`>`, `>>`, `<`):**
  - `>`: Redirect output to a file (overwrites).
  - `>>`: Redirect output, appending to existing file content.
  - `<`: Redirect file content as input to commands.

## 💻 **Commands to Learn (Detailed)**

### **1. grep – Searching Text in Files**

- **Purpose:** Find specific patterns or text within files.

- **Syntax:**

```bash
grep [options] 'pattern' filename
```

- Common options:
  - `-i`: Case-insensitive search.
  - `-r`: Recursive search in directories.
  - `-n`: Show line numbers.

**Examples:**

```bash
grep 'error' logfile.txt             # Search for 'error' in logfile.txt
grep -i 'warning' logfile.txt        # Case-insensitive search
grep -rn 'TODO' /home/user/project/  # Recursively find 'TODO' with line numbers
```

---

### **2. find – Locate Files and Directories**

- **Purpose:** Locate files or directories based on name, type, size, etc.

- **Syntax:**

```bash
find [directory] [criteria]
```

- Common criteria:
  - `-name`: Search by filename.
  - `-type`: Type (`f` for file, `d` for directory).
  - `-size`: Search based on file size (`+100M`, `-10k`).

**Examples:**

```bash
find /home/user -name '*.log'           # Find all .log files in user home
find . -type d -name 'backup'           # Find directories named 'backup'
find /var/log -type f -size +50M        # Files larger than 50MB in /var/log
```

---

### **3. Pipes (`|`) – Connecting Commands**

- **Purpose:** Combine multiple commands, passing output from one to another.

**Examples:**

```bash
ls -l | grep '.txt'          # Lists only .txt files
ps aux | grep 'nginx'        # Finds processes related to nginx
cat logfile.txt | grep error | less  # View errors interactively
```

---

### **4. Redirection (`>`, `>>`, `<`)**

- **Purpose:** Direct command output to or input from files.

**Examples:**

```bash
ls > filelist.txt            # Saves output of ls to filelist.txt (overwrite)
echo "new entry" >> log.txt  # Appends text to log.txt
grep 'error' < logfile.txt   # Reads logfile.txt as input for grep
```

## 🎯 **Practical Exercise Suggestion**

Practice independently to reinforce today’s commands:

1. Use `grep` to find a specific pattern in a text file.
2. Use `find` to locate files ending with `.sh` in your home directory.
3. Combine `ps aux`, `grep`, and pipes to list running processes containing 'bash'.
4. Redirect output of `ls -la` to `my_files.txt`.
5. Append additional content to the `my_files.txt` using redirection.

## 📝 **Quiz Section (End of Day)**

**1.** Which command finds all `.txt` files recursively under the current directory?

- Fill in the blank:

```bash
find . -type __ -name '*.txt'
```

**2.** How do you search the file `logs.txt` for lines containing the word "FAILED" (case-insensitive)?

- a) `grep FAILED logs.txt`
- b) `grep -i FAILED logs.txt`
- c) `grep -n FAILED logs.txt`

**3.** Which pipe (`|`) command lists processes related to `python`?

- a) `ps aux | grep python`
- b) `ps aux > grep python`
- c) `ps aux >> grep python`

**4.** Which command appends output to an existing file without overwriting?

- a) `ls > file.txt`
- b) `ls >> file.txt`
- c) `ls < file.txt`

**5.** What's the purpose of `<` in `grep error < logfile.txt`?

- a) Redirects error messages
- b) Redirects logfile.txt content as input to grep
- c) Saves grep output into logfile.txt

## ❓ **FAQ Section**

**Q1:** What’s the difference between `grep -i` and `grep -n`?

- **A:** `grep -i` ignores case sensitivity, whereas `grep -n` includes line numbers in output.

**Q2:** Can I combine multiple commands using more than one pipe (`|`)?

- **A:** Absolutely. You can chain commands like `cmd1 | cmd2 | cmd3` to build powerful data-processing pipelines.

**Q3:** What’s the difference between `>` and `>>`?

- **A:** `>` overwrites existing file content, while `>>` appends to the existing content without overwriting.

**Q4:** Can `find` search by modification date?

- **A:** Yes, using options like `-mtime` (modified time). Example: `find . -mtime -1` (modified within the last day).

## 🚧 **Common Issues Section**

### **Issue 1:** `"grep: *.txt: No such file or directory"`

- **Reason:** Wildcards not expanded properly when quoted.
- **Solution:** Ensure no quotes around wildcards or use correctly.  

  ```bash
  grep 'pattern' *.txt
  ```

### **Issue 2:** `"find: missing argument to '-name'"`

- **Reason:** Forgot to specify a filename pattern after `-name`.
- **Solution:** Always include filename pattern:

  ```bash
  find . -name '*.log'
  ```

## 🎯 **Outstanding work today!**

You've gained essential skills in text searching, file locating, and command chaining—major steps towards mastering Linux productivity.

Tomorrow, we'll expand into more sophisticated text manipulation using powerful commands like `sed`, `awk`, and more complex pipes.

Keep up the great practice!
