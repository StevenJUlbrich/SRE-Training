## Here are the answers and explanations for Day 8â€™s quiz questions

---

### **Question 1:**  

**How would you add a new user called `john` with a home directory?**

âœ… **Correct Answer (fill-in-the-blank):**

```bash
useradd -m john
```

**Explanation:**  

- The `-m` option creates the user's home directory (`/home/john`). Without it, no home directory is created automatically.

---

### **Question 2:**  

**Which command completely removes a user named `john` and their home directory?**

âœ… **Correct Answer:**  
**b)** `userdel -r john`

**Explanation:**  

- **Option a)** `userdel john`: Removes user but keeps their home directory.
- **Option c)** `usermod -r john`: Invalid syntax; `usermod` modifies users but does not remove them.

`userdel -r` correctly removes the user and deletes their home directory and associated files.

### **Question 3:**  

**Which command changes the password for user `john`?**

âœ… **Correct Answer (fill-in-the-blank):**

```bash
passwd john
```

**Explanation:**  

- The `passwd` command is specifically used to update user passwords.

---

### **Question 4:**  

**How do you add user `john` to the group `staff` without removing him from other groups?**

âœ… **Correct Answer:**  
**a)** `usermod -aG staff john`

**Explanation:**  

- **Option b)** `usermod -g staff john`: Sets the primary group to `staff`, removing the user from existing supplementary groups.
- **Option c)** `groupadd staff john`: Invalid syntax; `groupadd` creates groups, doesn't assign users.

`-aG` correctly adds the user to additional groups without affecting existing memberships.

---

### **Question 5:**  

**Which command shows detailed information about the group named `admins`?**

âœ… **Correct Answer:**  
**b)** `getent group admins`

**Explanation:**  

- **Option a)** `cat /etc/passwd admins`: Incorrect; `/etc/passwd` stores user details, not group information.
- **Option c)** `passwd admins`: Incorrect; used to change passwords, not view group details.

`getent group admins` accurately retrieves detailed group information.
