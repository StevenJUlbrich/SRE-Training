# 🚀 **Day 8: User & Group Management – Managing Access and Security**

---

## 📌 **Introduction**

### 🔄 **Recap of Day 7:**

Yesterday, you gained essential networking skills, including connectivity testing (`ping`), interface management (`ifconfig`, `ip addr`), monitoring active connections (`netstat`, `ss`), and secure remote operations (`ssh`, `scp`).

### 📅 **Today's Topics and Importance:**

Today, you'll explore **User & Group Management**. Effective management of users and groups is critical for securing your Linux system and managing permissions and access.

### 🎯 **Learning Objectives:**

By the end of Day 8, you will be able to:

- Create, delete, and modify users (`useradd`, `userdel`, `usermod`).
- Create and manage groups (`groupadd`, `groupdel`).
- Manage passwords and authentication (`passwd`).
- View user information via `/etc/passwd` and the `getent` command.

---

## 📚 **Core Concepts Explained**

- **Users & Groups:** Fundamental elements of Linux security, determining access permissions.
- **User management:** Adding/removing users, changing user settings, securing accounts.
- **Groups:** Simplify permission management by grouping users who require similar access.

## 💻 **Commands to Learn (Detailed)**

### **1. User Management (`useradd`, `userdel`, `usermod`)**

- **`useradd` – Create new users**

  ```bash
  sudo useradd alice            # Adds a new user 'alice'
  sudo useradd -m bob           # Adds 'bob' and creates home directory
  ```

- **`userdel` – Remove existing users**

  ```bash
  sudo userdel alice            # Removes user 'alice' but keeps home directory
  sudo userdel -r bob           # Removes user 'bob' and deletes home directory
  ```

- **`usermod` – Modify existing users**

  ```bash
  sudo usermod -aG developers alice    # Adds 'alice' to 'developers' group
  sudo usermod -l newname oldname      # Renames user 'oldname' to 'newname'
  ```

---

### **2. Group Management (`groupadd`, `groupdel`)**

- **`groupadd` – Create groups**

  ```bash
  sudo groupadd developers     # Creates a group 'developers'
  ```

- **`groupdel` – Delete groups**

  ```bash
  sudo groupdel developers     # Deletes the 'developers' group
  ```

---

### **3. Password Management (`passwd`)**

- **`passwd` – Set or change passwords**

  ```bash
  passwd                        # Change your own password
  sudo passwd alice             # Change password for user 'alice'
  ```

---

### **4. Viewing Users and Groups (`/etc/passwd`, `getent`)**

- **`/etc/passwd` – View basic user info**

  ```bash
  cat /etc/passwd               # Displays all users
  grep alice /etc/passwd        # Find specific user details
  ```

- **`getent` – Detailed info about users/groups**

  ```bash
  getent passwd alice           # Retrieves info for user 'alice'
  getent group developers       # Retrieves info for group 'developers'
  ```

---

## 🎯 **Practical Exercise Suggestion**

Perform the following tasks to reinforce today's learning:

1. Create a new user named `testuser` and verify its creation.
2. Add the user `testuser` to a new group called `project`.
3. Set a password for `testuser`.
4. Rename `testuser` to `demo_user`.
5. Delete the user `demo_user` and its home directory.

## 📝 **Quiz Section (End of Day)**

**1.** How would you add a new user called `john` with a home directory?

- Fill in the blank:

```bash
useradd ___ john
```

**2.** Which command completely removes a user named `john` and their home directory?

- a) `userdel john`
- b) `userdel -r john`
- c) `usermod -r john`

**3.** Which command changes the password for user `john`?

- Fill in the blank:

```bash
____ john
```

**4.** How do you add user `john` to the group `staff` without removing him from other groups?

- a) `usermod -aG staff john`
- b) `usermod -g staff john`
- c) `groupadd staff john`

**5.** Which command shows detailed information about the group named `admins`?

- a) `cat /etc/passwd admins`
- b) `getent group admins`
- c) `passwd admins`

## ❓ **FAQ Section**

**Q1:** What's the difference between `useradd` and `adduser`?

- **A:** `useradd` is standard and basic; `adduser` (on Debian-based systems) is interactive, more user-friendly.

**Q2:** Can I change a username directly?

- **A:** Yes, using `usermod -l newname oldname`.

**Q3:** How can I list groups a user belongs to?

- **A:** Use `groups username` or `id username`.

**Q4:** Can I lock or disable user accounts temporarily?

- **A:** Yes, use `passwd -l username` to lock and `passwd -u username` to unlock.

## 🚧 **Common Issues Section**

### **Issue 1:** `"useradd: user 'john' already exists"`

- **Reason:** Username already taken.
- **Solution:** Choose another username or delete existing user if appropriate (`userdel`).

### **Issue 2:** `"usermod: group 'staff' does not exist"`

- **Reason:** You're adding a user to a non-existent group.
- **Solution:** Create group first (`groupadd staff`) or check for typos.

## 🎯 **Outstanding progress today!**

You've mastered fundamental Linux user and group management, crucial for secure and effective system administration.

Tomorrow, you'll learn about archiving and compression (`tar`, `gzip`, `zip`) and essential package management techniques.

Keep practicing and building your skills!
