# Day 9: Aanya's Archive Architecture

*09:45 IST - Bengaluru, India*

Aanya arrived at CloudCrest's Bengaluru office with her customary thermos of masala chai, a stack of sticky notes, and the pleasant buzz of being back after a weekend spent hiking in the Western Ghats with her photography club. Her desk—immaculately organized with color-coded folders and a miniature Zen garden—stood in stark contrast to the barely controlled chaos of her hiking backpack, which lay propped against the wall still caked with mountain mud.

Unlike Taylor, whose path to tech had been somewhat accidental, Aanya had grown up in a family of engineers in Pune. Her parents had expected her to pursue medicine, but a summer coding camp at age 13 had changed everything. By 16, she was already contributing to open-source projects, and by college, she had three patents to her name. What most people didn't know was that she also wrote sci-fi short stories under a pen name and had a growing collection of vintage mechanical puzzles that she restored in her spare time.

She pulled up Taylor's handoff message while settling in:

> **@Noah:** I've implemented the new user and group structure for the analytics platform:
> 
> 1. Created separate service accounts for each component (upload, process, archive, api)
> 2. Set up appropriate groups (readers, writers) for access control
> 3. Updated directory permissions and ownership to match the new structure
> 4. Locked service accounts and enforced password policies for human accounts
> 5. Created documentation in /var/app/uploads/USER_PERMISSIONS.md
> 
> The changes have been deployed to both staging and production. The system is now ready for the new code deployment scheduled for tomorrow.
> 
> Also, I can't believe how much we've accomplished as a team in just one week! From that first disk space alert to a completely restructured, properly secured platform. I might actually sleep tonight without dreaming of runaway log files!

"Noah's going to be disappointed," Aanya chuckled, seeing that Taylor had accidentally addressed her message to Noah instead of him. "The hazards of a global team—it's easy to lose track of who's next in the rotation."

Nevertheless, the contents were clear. The user and group structure was now properly in place, which meant Aanya could move forward with implementing a more robust archiving, backup, and deployment system for the analytics platform.

She connected to the production server:

```bash
$ ssh analytics-prod-03
```

First, she wanted to check what Taylor had done with the user permissions:

```bash
$ cat /var/app/uploads/USER_PERMISSIONS.md
```

The documentation was clear and detailed. Perfect.

Next, Aanya assessed the current state of file storage and backup:

```bash
$ df -h
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda1       120G   74G   40G  65% /
/dev/sdb1       500G  327G  148G  69% /var
```

Though the immediate disk space issue had been resolved, the server was still using a significant amount of its available space. It was time to implement proper archiving and compression to manage this more effectively.

She checked the current size of the analytics directories:

```bash
$ du -sh /var/app/uploads/*
4.2G  /var/app/uploads/archive
1.1G  /var/app/uploads/incoming
850M  /var/app/uploads/processing
```

"Over 6GB of data and growing daily. We definitely need better archive management," Aanya muttered.

First, she wanted to create a comprehensive backup of the current system before making any changes:

```bash
$ sudo mkdir -p /backup/analytics
```

But as she prepared to create a tarball, she realized something important. 

"I should check if there's already a backup system in place that I might be interfering with," she said to herself.

```bash
$ find /backup -type f -name "*.tar.gz" | head
```

Finding nothing relevant, she proceeded with her backup:

```bash
$ sudo tar -czvf /backup/analytics/full_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz /var/app/uploads
```

The command compressed and archived the entire uploads directory into a timestamped tarball. She verified the backup:

```bash
$ ls -lh /backup/analytics/
total 3.8G
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 3.8G Apr 14 09:55 full_backup_20250414.tar.gz
```

She checked the integrity of the backup:

```bash
$ tar -tzf /backup/analytics/full_backup_20250414.tar.gz | head -10
```

The output confirmed the backup contained all the expected directories and files.

Next, Aanya wanted to implement a proper archive rotation system. She created a script:

```bash
$ vim /home/aanya/scripts/archive_rotation.sh
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# archive_rotation.sh - Created by Aanya
# Compresses and rotates old analytics data

# Configuration
ARCHIVE_DIR="/var/app/uploads/archive"
BACKUP_DIR="/backup/analytics/archives"
MAX_AGE_DAYS=30
COMPRESS_AGE_DAYS=7
TODAY=$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Ensure backup directory exists
mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"

# Log function
log() {
    echo "$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S') - $1"
}

log "Starting archive rotation..."

# Find old files (>30 days) and move to long-term storage
log "Finding files older than $MAX_AGE_DAYS days..."
find "$ARCHIVE_DIR" -type f -mtime +$MAX_AGE_DAYS | while read -r file; do
    # Create monthly directory if it doesn't exist
    month_dir="$BACKUP_DIR/$(date -r "$file" +%Y-%m)"
    mkdir -p "$month_dir"
    
    # Create tar.gz archive for each file
    filename=$(basename "$file")
    tar -czf "$month_dir/${filename}.tar.gz" "$file"
    
    # Verify integrity
    if tar -tzf "$month_dir/${filename}.tar.gz" &>/dev/null; then
        log "Successfully archived $filename to $month_dir"
        # Remove original file
        rm "$file"
    else
        log "ERROR: Failed to verify archive for $filename"
    fi
done

# Compress files older than 7 days but younger than 30 days
log "Compressing files between $COMPRESS_AGE_DAYS and $MAX_AGE_DAYS days old..."
find "$ARCHIVE_DIR" -type f -mtime +$COMPRESS_AGE_DAYS -mtime -$MAX_AGE_DAYS -not -name "*.gz" | while read -r file; do
    gzip -v "$file"
    if [ -f "${file}.gz" ]; then
        log "Successfully compressed $file"
    else
        log "ERROR: Failed to compress $file"
    fi
done

# Generate archive report
REPORT="$BACKUP_DIR/archive_report_$TODAY.txt"
{
    echo "CloudCrest Analytics Archive Report - $TODAY"
    echo "============================================="
    echo
    echo "Current Archive Status:"
    echo "Files in active archive: $(find "$ARCHIVE_DIR" -type f | wc -l)"
    echo "Files in long-term storage: $(find "$BACKUP_DIR" -type f -name "*.tar.gz" | wc -l)"
    echo "Total archive size: $(du -sh "$ARCHIVE_DIR" "$BACKUP_DIR" | awk '{sum+=$1} END {print sum}')"
    echo
    echo "Archive Distribution by Month:"
    for month_dir in "$BACKUP_DIR"/*/; do
        if [ -d "$month_dir" ]; then
            month=$(basename "$month_dir")
            count=$(find "$month_dir" -type f | wc -l)
            size=$(du -sh "$month_dir" | awk '{print $1}')
            echo "$month: $count files ($size)"
        fi
    done
} > "$REPORT"

log "Archive rotation completed. Report saved to $REPORT"
```

She made the script executable:

```bash
$ chmod +x /home/aanya/scripts/archive_rotation.sh
```

Next, Aanya created a script to check for disk usage and automatically compress files if space was running low:

```bash
$ vim /home/aanya/scripts/disk_space_monitor.sh
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# disk_space_monitor.sh - Created by Aanya
# Monitors disk space and takes action when thresholds are reached

# Configuration
THRESHOLD_WARNING=75
THRESHOLD_CRITICAL=85
VAR_PARTITION="/var"
ARCHIVE_DIR="/var/app/uploads/archive"
LOG_FILE="/var/log/disk_monitor.log"

# Log function
log() {
    echo "$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S') - $1" >> "$LOG_FILE"
    echo "$1"
}

# Get current disk usage percentage
usage=$(df -h "$VAR_PARTITION" | awk 'NR==2 {print $5}' | tr -d '%')

log "Current disk usage on $VAR_PARTITION: $usage%"

if [ "$usage" -ge "$THRESHOLD_CRITICAL" ]; then
    log "CRITICAL: Disk usage exceeded critical threshold! Taking emergency action..."
    
    # Find the largest uncompressed files in archive and compress them
    log "Finding and compressing large files..."
    find "$ARCHIVE_DIR" -type f -not -name "*.gz" -size +10M | 
    sort -k5 -nr | 
    head -20 | 
    while read -r file; do
        log "Compressing $file..."
        gzip -v "$file"
    done
    
    # If still critical, move oldest archives to backup
    if [ "$(df -h "$VAR_PARTITION" | awk 'NR==2 {print $5}' | tr -d '%')" -ge "$THRESHOLD_CRITICAL" ]; then
        log "Still critical! Moving oldest archives to backup..."
        /home/aanya/scripts/archive_rotation.sh
    fi
    
elif [ "$usage" -ge "$THRESHOLD_WARNING" ]; then
    log "WARNING: Disk usage exceeded warning threshold!"
    
    # Compress files older than 3 days (more aggressive than regular rotation)
    log "Compressing files older than 3 days..."
    find "$ARCHIVE_DIR" -type f -mtime +3 -not -name "*.gz" | 
    while read -r file; do
        gzip -v "$file"
    done
else
    log "Disk usage is within normal range."
fi

# Final usage after actions
final_usage=$(df -h "$VAR_PARTITION" | awk 'NR==2 {print $5}' | tr -d '%')
log "Final disk usage: $final_usage%"

if [ "$final_usage" -ne "$usage" ]; then
    log "Freed $((usage - final_usage))% disk space."
fi
```

She made this script executable as well:

```bash
$ chmod +x /home/aanya/scripts/disk_space_monitor.sh
```

Now that the archive management scripts were in place, Aanya turned her attention to the package management aspect of the deployment. She needed to create a self-contained package for the analytics code that could be easily deployed and rolled back if necessary.

First, she checked the current package management system:

```bash
$ dpkg --version
```

The server was running a Debian-based distribution, which meant she could use `apt` and `dpkg` for package management.

Next, she wanted to create a standardized deployment package. She first set up a directory structure for the package:

```bash
$ mkdir -p ~/deployment/analytics-package/DEBIAN
$ mkdir -p ~/deployment/analytics-package/opt/analytics/{bin,etc,lib,scripts}
$ mkdir -p ~/deployment/analytics-package/etc/systemd/system
```

She created a control file for the package:

```bash
$ vim ~/deployment/analytics-package/DEBIAN/control
```

```
Package: cloudcrest-analytics
Version: 1.0.0
Section: custom
Priority: optional
Architecture: all
Essential: no
Installed-Size: 13000
Maintainer: CloudCrest SRE Team <sre-team@cloudcrest.example>
Description: CloudCrest Analytics Platform
 Complete package for the CloudCrest Analytics Platform
 including upload, processing, archiving, and API components.
```

Next, she created pre-installation and post-installation scripts:

```bash
$ vim ~/deployment/analytics-package/DEBIAN/preinst
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Pre-installation script
echo "Running pre-installation checks..."

# Check if necessary users exist
for user in analytics-admin analytics-upload analytics-process analytics-archive analytics-api; do
    if ! id -u "$user" &>/dev/null; then
        echo "ERROR: Required user $user does not exist!"
        exit 1
    fi
done

# Check if directories exist
if [ ! -d "/var/app/uploads" ]; then
    echo "ERROR: Required directory /var/app/uploads does not exist!"
    exit 1
fi

# Create backup of existing configuration
if [ -d "/opt/analytics" ]; then
    echo "Backing up existing configuration..."
    tar -czf "/root/analytics_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S).tar.gz" /opt/analytics/etc
fi

echo "Pre-installation checks completed successfully."
```

```bash
$ vim ~/deployment/analytics-package/DEBIAN/postinst
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Post-installation script
echo "Running post-installation configuration..."

# Set correct permissions
chown -R analytics-admin:analytics-admin /opt/analytics
chown analytics-upload:analytics-writers /opt/analytics/scripts/upload.sh
chown analytics-process:analytics-writers /opt/analytics/scripts/process.sh
chown analytics-archive:analytics-readers /opt/analytics/scripts/archive.sh
chown analytics-api:analytics-readers /opt/analytics/scripts/api.sh

chmod 750 /opt/analytics/scripts/*.sh

# Enable and start services
systemctl daemon-reload
for service in analytics-upload analytics-processing analytics-archiver analytics-api; do
    systemctl enable $service
    systemctl restart $service
done

echo "Post-installation configuration completed successfully."
```

She made these scripts executable:

```bash
$ chmod +x ~/deployment/analytics-package/DEBIAN/preinst
$ chmod +x ~/deployment/analytics-package/DEBIAN/postinst
```

Now, Aanya needed to copy the actual application files into the package structure. For this example, she used placeholder files:

```bash
$ echo "#!/bin/bash\necho 'Analytics Upload Service started'" > ~/deployment/analytics-package/opt/analytics/bin/upload-service
$ echo "#!/bin/bash\necho 'Analytics Processing Service started'" > ~/deployment/analytics-package/opt/analytics/bin/processing-service
$ echo "#!/bin/bash\necho 'Analytics Archiver Service started'" > ~/deployment/analytics-package/opt/analytics/bin/archiver-service
$ echo "#!/bin/bash\necho 'Analytics API Service started'" > ~/deployment/analytics-package/opt/analytics/bin/api-service

$ chmod +x ~/deployment/analytics-package/opt/analytics/bin/*
```

She created systemd service files:

```bash
$ vim ~/deployment/analytics-package/etc/systemd/system/analytics-upload.service
```

```
[Unit]
Description=CloudCrest Analytics Upload Service
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=analytics-upload
Group=analytics-writers
ExecStart=/opt/analytics/bin/upload-service
Restart=on-failure
LimitNOFILE=65536

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

She created similar service files for the other components (processing, archiver, and API) with appropriate user and group settings.

Now, she needed to create some sample configuration files:

```bash
$ vim ~/deployment/analytics-package/opt/analytics/etc/upload.conf
```

```
# Upload Service Configuration
port = 8081
max_upload_size = 100MB
upload_dir = /var/app/uploads/incoming
log_level = INFO
```

She created similar configuration files for the other components.

With the package structure complete, Aanya built the Debian package:

```bash
$ dpkg-deb --build ~/deployment/analytics-package
```

This created a `.deb` package file:

```bash
$ ls -lh ~/deployment/
total 14M
drwxr-xr-x 5 aanya aanya 4.0K Apr 14 10:30 analytics-package
-rw-r--r-- 1 aanya aanya  14M Apr 14 10:40 analytics-package.deb
```

Aanya renamed the package to include versioning:

```bash
$ mv ~/deployment/analytics-package.deb ~/deployment/cloudcrest-analytics_1.0.0_all.deb
```

To ensure easy rollback capabilities, Aanya created a deployment script:

```bash
$ vim ~/scripts/deploy_analytics.sh
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# deploy_analytics.sh - Created by Aanya
# Deploys the CloudCrest Analytics package with rollback capabilities

        return 1

    local backup_file="/backup/analytics/pre_deploy_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).tar.gz"
    
    if [ -d "/opt/analytics" ]; then
        tar -czf "$backup_file" /opt/analytics /etc/systemd/system/analytics-*.service
        
        if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
            log "Backup created: $backup_file"
            return 0
        else
            log "ERROR: Backup creation failed!"
            return 1

# Run the main function

exit $?
```

She made the script executable:

```bash
$ chmod +x ~/scripts/deploy_analytics.sh
```

To round out her work, Aanya created one more script to handle full system backups, including both the application code and data:

```bash
$ vim ~/scripts/full_system_backup.sh
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# full_system_backup.sh - Created by Aanya

find "$BACKUP_DIR" -name "full_backup_*.tar.gz" -mtime +$BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS -delete

log "Backup completed: $BACKUP_DIR/full_backup_$TODAY.tar.gz"
```

She made this script executable as well:

```bash
$ chmod +x ~/scripts/full_system_backup.sh
```

Finally, Aanya set up cron jobs to run her scripts on a schedule:

```bash
$ crontab -e
```

She added:

```
# Run archive rotation daily at 1 AM
0 1 * * * /home/aanya/scripts/archive_rotation.sh >> /var/log/archive_rotation.log 2>&1

# Run disk space monitor every hour
0 * * * * /home/aanya/scripts/disk_space_monitor.sh >> /var/log/disk_monitor.log 2>&1

# Run full system backup weekly on Sunday at 2 AM
0 2 * * 0 /home/aanya/scripts/full_system_backup.sh >> /var/log/full_backup.log 2>&1
```

With all her scripts in place, Aanya ran a test of the full system backup to verify everything worked correctly:

```bash
$ ~/scripts/full_system_backup.sh
```

The backup completed successfully, giving her confidence in the new system.

As her shift was ending, Aanya prepared a handoff for Luis in Madrid:

> **@Luis:** I've implemented comprehensive archiving, compression, and package management for the analytics platform:
> 
> 1. Created an advanced archive rotation system that compresses files based on age and automatically moves old data to long-term storage
> 2. Implemented disk space monitoring that takes proactive actions when thresholds are reached
> 3. Built a complete Debian package for our analytics services with proper versioning
> 4. Created deployment scripts with automatic rollback capabilities
> 5. Set up a full system backup solution that runs weekly
> 
> All scripts are documented and scheduled via cron. The package is ready for deployment in ~/deployment/cloudcrest-analytics_1.0.0_all.deb.
> 
> I also noticed Taylor's message was accidentally addressed to Noah instead of you—the hazards of a global team! Hope you're having a great day in Madrid.

As the afternoon sun streamed through the office windows, Aanya looked at her work with satisfaction. The analytics platform had come a long way in just over a week. What had started as a simple disk space issue had led to a complete overhaul of the system's architecture, security, and operational procedures.

"From chaos to control," she said to herself as she packed up her things. "That's what SRE is all about."

She glanced at her hiking backpack, still covered in mud, and smiled. Whether scaling mountains or fixing complex systems, the same methodical approach worked: assess the situation, create a plan, implement carefully, and always have a backup strategy.
