# 🚀 Linux SRE Training Module Synthesis Prompt (v1.0)

## 🧑‍🏫 Role
You are an expert Linux instructor and SRE engineer tasked with creating the optimal training module by synthesizing the strengths of two existing documents on Shell Scripting.

## 🎯 Objective
Create a comprehensive, improved training module by synthesizing:
- **Document 1 (v3)**: Rich in detailed explanations, comprehensive examples, and in-depth content
- **Document 3 (v5)**: Strong in structure, visual organization, and explicit SRE context

Your synthesis should:
- Combine the comprehensive depth of Document 1 with the clear organization of Document 3
- Maintain a consistent progression from Beginner → Intermediate → SRE-level
- Preserve the explicit SRE context and real-world scenarios
- Result in a document that exceeds the quality of either source document

## 📋 Document Analysis and Synthesis Strategy

### Strengths to Preserve from Document 1 (v3)
- Comprehensive explanations and detailed examples
- In-depth database backup script example
- Extensive FAQ section with detailed answers
- Thorough troubleshooting guidance
- Wide range of practical exercises

### Strengths to Preserve from Document 3 (v5)
- Clear visual organization with emojis and consistent formatting
- Explicit tiered examples with skill-level markers (🔍, 🧩, 💡)
- Tabular presentation of command syntax
- Direct connections to SRE applications for each concept
- Consistent instructional notes (tips, insights, pitfalls)

### Synthesis Approach
1. **Structure**: Use Document 3's visual organization and consistent formatting
2. **Content Depth**: Incorporate Document 1's comprehensive explanations
3. **Examples**: Combine the best examples from both documents, maintaining tiered progression
4. **SRE Context**: Ensure all content has explicit SRE relevance as in Document 3
5. **Exercises & Activities**: Merge and enhance exercises from both documents
6. **Visual Elements**: Use Document 3's emojis, tables, and formatting consistently

## Topic Focus for Day 10
- Shell script basics (structure, execution)
- Variables and command substitution
- Loops (for, while)
- Conditionals (if, case)
- Environment variables (export, .bashrc/.zshrc)

## 📋 Required Sections

### 📌 Introduction
- Summarize the importance of shell scripting for SREs
- Define clear objectives for each skill level (3 per tier)
- Connect to previous learning and future topics
- Include Document 1's recap of the previous day's content

### 📚 Core Concepts
For each concept include:
- Beginner-friendly explanation (from Document 1)
- Technical detail (from Document 1)

- System impact (from Document 3)

### 💻 Command Breakdown
For each concept (variables, command substitution, loops, conditionals, environment variables) provide:
- Purpose and SRE relevance (synthesized from both documents)
- Syntax table with examples (format from Document 3)
- Tiered examples (2+ per level) with realistic outputs (best from both documents)
- Instructional notes (2+ tips, 2+ insights, 2+ pitfalls)

Use this exact format from Document 3:

```
**Command: [command_name] ([command_full_name])**

**Command Overview:**
[Detailed description of command purpose and when/why SREs use it]

**Syntax & Flags:**

| Flag/Option | Syntax Example | Description | SRE Usage Context |
|-------------|----------------|-------------|-------------------|
| [flag1] | [example] | [description] | [when SREs use this flag] |
| [flag2] | [example] | [description] | [when SREs use this flag] |
| [etc...] | [example] | [description] | [when SREs use this flag] |

**Tiered Examples:**

* 🔍 **Beginner Example:**
```bash
# Example: [clear purpose statement]
$ [command with basic options]
[realistic terminal output]
# [Optional brief explanation if needed]
```

* 🧩 **Intermediate Example:**
```bash
# Example: [specific operational context]
$ [command with more complex options]
[realistic terminal output]
# Explicit context: [operational significance explanation]
```

* 💡 **SRE-Level Example:**
```bash
# Example: [realistic SRE scenario like troubleshooting/automation]
$ [complex command possibly combining with other tools]
[realistic terminal output]
# Explicit context: [production relevance, incident context, or automation purpose]
```

**Instructional Notes:**

* 🧠 **Beginner Tip:** [practical advice for newcomers]
* 🧠 **Beginner Tip:** [practical advice for newcomers]

* 🔧 **SRE Insight:** [operational wisdom from real-world experience]
* 🔧 **SRE Insight:** [operational wisdom from real-world experience]
