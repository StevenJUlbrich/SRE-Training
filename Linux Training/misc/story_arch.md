**The Follow-the-Sun Chronicles: Story Arc**

This version reflects timezone-accurate handoffs and retains the original cast of characters in a global SRE team.

---

🗓️ **Day-by-Day Story Arc**

### **Day 1 (Taylor, USA) – Arrival and Orientation**
Taylor joins CloudCrest and handles a real incident by learning `pwd`, `cd`, `ls`, and `man` in the middle of a disk usage scare. Ends by handing off an unresolved analytics config issue to the overnight team in Australia.
📦 Topic: Navigation + Shell basics  
🔁 Handoff: Taylor sends a note to Noah about the bloated logs and mysterious `/etc/analytics/service.conf` behavior.

---

### **Day 2 (Noah, Australia) – Log Triage and Live Monitoring**
Noah picks up the log trail, starts investigating `/var/app/uploads`, and uses `tail`, `less`, and `grep` to isolate runaway logs. Notices inconsistent ownership and log growth patterns.
📦 Topic: Live log triage, monitoring, log growth detection  
🔁 Handoff: Leaves a detailed note for Aanya flagging mixed ownership and unrotated logs.

---

### **Day 3 (Aanya, India) – File Management & Incident Cleanup**
Aanya picks up Noah's observations and creates a proper backup plan using `cp`, `mv`, and `touch`. She rotates logs, automates the cleanup script, and fixes directory permissions.
📦 Topic: File manipulation  
🔁 Handoff: Aanya flags inconsistent log writers and prepares Luis to investigate process ownership and spawning.

---

### **Day 4 (Luis, Spain) – Permissions Forensics**
Luis dives into `/var/app/uploads` with `ls -l`, `chmod`, `chown`, and `ps`. Traces the issue to a misconfigured upload script launching subprocesses as different users. Adds `setgid` and sticky bits.
📦 Topic: Permissions + Ownership  
🔁 Handoff: Leaves a note for Fatima about suspicious activity in rotated logs; recommends a deep dive with `find` and `grep`.

---

### **Day 5 (Fatima, UAE) – Searching for the Unknown**
Fatima uses `grep`, `find`, and pipes to dig through logs. Detects secrets leaking into rotated logs due to a faulty crontab. Builds a report.
📦 Topic: Text search & command chaining  
🔁 Handoff: Forwards filtered logs to Jin with suggestions for secret scrubbing and better post-processing.

---

### **Day 6 (Jin, Korea) – Text Processing & Secret Removal**
Jin crafts a `sed` + `awk` solution to sanitize secrets. Uses `sort`, `uniq`, and `wc` to report impact and adds post-processing to the log rotation script.
📦 Topic: sed, awk, sort, wc, etc.  
🔁 Handoff: Spots a suspicious CPU spike tied to logging and tags Noah to investigate system metrics.

---

### **Day 7 (Noah Returns, Australia) – Process Taming**
Noah checks with `ps`, `top`, `htop`, and `watch`, finds a rogue Python service, and terminates it with `kill`. Adds memory usage alerts.
📦 Topic: Process monitoring & system load  
🔁 Handoff: Passes along container traffic anomalies to Mina for network review.

---

### **Day 8 (Mina, Nigeria) – Network Sleuthing**
Mina uses `ping`, `netstat`, `ss`, and `ssh` tunnels to trace a misrouted internal service. Collects logs via `scp` and prepares redeployment plan.
📦 Topic: Networking basics  
🔁 Handoff: Notifies Taylor to redeploy service accounts for new rollout.

---

### **Day 9 (Taylor Returns, USA) – Identity Matters**
Taylor, now confident, uses `useradd`, `usermod`, `groupadd`, and `passwd` to provision new service users. Enforces password policies and sudo access.
📦 Topic: User & group management  
🔁 Handoff: Notes that archive packaging is still manual; nudges Aanya to automate it.

---

### **Day 10 (Aanya Returns, India) – Packaging Perfection**
Aanya automates deployment bundles using `tar`, `gzip`, and `apt`. Builds a rollback archive strategy and logs it all for handoff.
📦 Topic: Archiving, compression, package management  
🔁 Handoff: Tells Jin, "automate me completely."

---

### **Day 11 (Jin Closes the Loop, Korea) – Full Automation**
Jin writes a full shell script using `bash`, `for`, `if`, `case`, and `env`. Includes error handling, logging, alert hooks, and even some ASCII art. Pushes it to CI/CD.
📦 Topic: Shell scripting  
🔦 Final Touch: Tags the team: “Clean handoff. Zero issues. Let’s see how long that lasts.”
