You are provided two separate training documents focused on Linux fundamentals:

 Emphasizes simple explanations, basic Linux commands, introductory exercises, FAQs, and troubleshooting.
 Highlights Linux fundamentals with detailed SRE contexts, real-world scenarios, and advanced command usage.

### Your task is to generate a comprehensive combined document (Version 3) that:

1. **Integrates strengths of both documents**:
   - Beginner-friendliness and clarity from Document A.
   - Technical depth and direct SRE relevance from Document B.

2. **Follows a structured, layered learning approach** clearly identified by sections:
   - **Beginner Sections:** Essential basics and command usage.
   - **Intermediate Sections:** Detailed command options and examples.
   - **SRE Application Sections:** Realistic scenarios demonstrating direct application in SRE roles.

3. **Uses clear and consistent formatting**:
   - Clearly labeled headings, subheadings, and section titles.
   - Well-defined syntax blocks, practical examples, and explanations.
   - Callouts labeled as "Beginner's Notes," "Intermediate Insights," and "SRE Perspectives" when providing relevant tips or contextual information.

4. **Includes comprehensive support sections**:
   - Structured practical exercises differentiated clearly by skill level.
   - Quizzes structured by difficulty levels: Beginner, Intermediate, and SRE Application.
   - Expanded FAQ and troubleshooting sections that offer clear, actionable advice relevant to real-world SRE work.
   - A realistic, detailed SRE scenario demonstrating practical usage of the day's concepts.

5. **Provides additional learning resources**:
   - Clearly organized resources by skill level (Beginner, Intermediate, SRE-specific).

### Ensure the final document is:
- Clearly organized and easy to navigate.
- Comprehensive yet accessible for different learner skill levels.
- Directly applicable to real-world SRE tasks and scenarios.
