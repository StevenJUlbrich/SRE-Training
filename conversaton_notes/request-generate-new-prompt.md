When you want me to generate a high-quality prompt based on a previous example and a new topic, here's an effective approach:

"Claude, I need to generate a new prompt for [specific topic] following the structure and quality of the previous prompt I shared with you. Please:

1. Analyze the previous prompt's structure, formatting, and key components
2. Identify the important elements that made it effective (section organization, detail level, visual aids, etc.)
3. Create a new prompt for [specific topic] that maintains the same quality standards
4. Adapt any topic-specific sections while preserving the overall framework
5. Enhance areas that could be improved based on your analysis of previous outputs

Please pay special attention to:
- Technical depth and practical examples
- Visual representation requirements (like Mermaid diagrams)
- The progression from beginner to advanced concepts
- Real-world application scenarios
- Formatting guidelines for consistent output

Use the 'Observe, Test, Evaluate, Act' approach to ensure the new prompt will produce results at least as good as the previous one."

This approach guides me to:
1. Systematically analyze what made the previous prompt effective
2. Maintain structural elements that worked well
3. Make appropriate adaptations for the new topic
4. Look for opportunities to improve based on previous outputs
5. Apply a methodical process to ensure quality and relevance

The reference to "Observe, Test, Evaluate, Act" reminds me to thoroughly examine the previous prompt, test my understanding against the new requirements, evaluate what needs to change, and create an improved version that will deliver excellent results for your specific needs.
