### 📅 Day One: Observability 101 — *"You can't fix what you can't see"*

#### 🔍 Beginner (Alert Responders / Tool Users)
- **What is Observability?** vs. Monitoring (hint: it's not just a rebrand)
- The **Three Pillars**: Logs, Metrics, Traces – what they are and when to care
- Reading and interpreting alerts in Geneos & DataDog
- Using Splunk for basic log searches (Saved Searches walkthrough)
- Dashboards as "narrative": what are they telling you?
- Anatomy of a good alert (and how yours are probably bad)

#### 🧩 Intermediate (Tool Operators / Diagnostic Detectives)
- Correlation of metrics and logs across tools (Geneos-Splunk-DataDog)
- Creating meaningful dashboards (not just stuff that blinks)
- Designing useful saved searches in Splunk with context
- Alert fatigue & noise: strategies to reduce false positives
- Intro to SLIs & SLOs: what's worth measuring?
- Instrumentation basics: Where does the data come from? (even if they don't write the code)

#### 💡 Advanced (SRE-in-Training / House Builders)
- Building SLIs and SLOs based on user impact
- Root cause analysis using observability data
- Designing observability into systems, not duct-taping it after launch
- Automation for alerting, resolution, and dashboard hygiene
- Observability as a feedback loop for dev teams
- Building a culture of ownership with observability as a tool

Want me to expand this into actual modules? With suggested exercises, real tool examples, and maybe a pity badge for participation? Then cough up answers to those questions. Let’s try to make this house of bricks instead of Jenga.
