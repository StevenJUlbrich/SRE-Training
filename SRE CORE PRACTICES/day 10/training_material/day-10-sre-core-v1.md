**Day 10. The Capstone.**  
You‚Äôve taught them how to measure, how to monitor, how to observe, and how to respond.  
Now it‚Äôs time to let them try‚Äînot by guessing on a quiz, but by **facing a complete, complex incident**.  
This is the final synthesis: **a chaotic, realistic, multi-signal scenario** where everything they've learned is tested.

And of course, everyone‚Äôs here: Hector, Mina, Felix, and Asha‚Äî**the full SRE ensemble**‚Äîguiding, reacting, and pushing learners through their final test.

# üß± **Day 10: Capstone ‚Äì Incident Simulation & Observability Deep Dive**

**Characters:**  
- Hector (commander)  
- Mina (triage)  
- Felix (metrics and SLOs)  
- Asha (logs, pipeline, trace correlation)  

**Vibe:** ‚ÄúThis is your war room. Welcome to the chaos.‚Äù

## üéØ Learning Objectives

### üîç Beginner
- Practice basic signal analysis across metrics, logs, and traces  
- Identify failure symptoms and correlate with user impact

### üß© Intermediate
- Build an incident timeline from multiple signals  
- Propose an SLO violation diagnosis using available data  
- Simulate communications and handoffs

### üí° Advanced / SRE-Level
- Coordinate a full incident lifecycle  
- Prioritize mitigation over noise  
- Conduct a blameless postmortem with structured learnings and follow-up items

## üí• Incident Scenario: **‚ÄúThe Black Friday Bottleneck‚Äù**

> 11:03 AM ‚Äî Alert fires: `Checkout latency > 500ms`  
> 11:05 AM ‚Äî Traces show delay in `tax-service`  
> 11:07 AM ‚Äî Logs reveal retry storms from `frontend-service`  
> 11:10 AM ‚Äî Prometheus shows cache evictions spiking  
> 11:13 AM ‚Äî SLO budget hit 50% for the day  
> 11:15 AM ‚Äî Customer support tickets begin to pile up  
> 11:16 AM ‚Äî SRE team paged  
> 11:30 AM ‚Äî Incident declared: SEV-1

## üî¨ Provided Assets (Simulation Bundle)

- **Metrics Dashboard** (PNG/Markdown table)
    - `request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.5"}` dropping  
    - `rate(5xx_errors_total[5m])` rising  
    - SLO burn rate chart: ~3x threshold

- **Trace Screenshot** (span 3 shows 1.2s delay)
    - `frontend-service` ‚Üí `checkout-service` ‚Üí `tax-service`  
    - `tax-service` span = bottleneck

- **Structured Logs** (sample lines)
```json
{"timestamp":"...","service":"frontend","status":500,"request_id":"abc123","trace_id":"xyz789","msg":"checkout failed"}
{"timestamp":"...","service":"tax-service","status":200,"duration":1230,"cache":"MISS"}
```

- **SLO Dashboard Snippet**
    - Target: 99.9% requests < 500ms
    - Budget left: 32 minutes
    - Consumed: 18 minutes in 90 minutes

## üß™ Simulation Flow

Learners must complete:

### üîπ Incident Timeline

| Time | Event | Signal | Action |
|------|-------|--------|--------|
| 11:03 | Alert fired | Metric | Notify IC |
| 11:05 | Trace span 3 shows latency | Trace | Identify tax-service as bottleneck |
| ...  | ... | ... | ... |

> üë©‚Äçüè´ **Exercise:** Fill out timeline with 6‚Äì8 events and responsible roles.

---

### üîπ SLO Violation Assessment

- Calculate % of failing requests  
- Determine burn rate  
- Estimate time to full budget depletion

---

### üîπ Root Cause Discovery

üìå Using:
- Trace delays  
- Logs (`cache: MISS`)  
- Cache eviction metrics

Learners must conclude:
> ‚ÄúTax-service degraded due to cache eviction and downstream cold responses under load. Retry storms created cascading latency.‚Äù

---

### üîπ Action Items

Must include:
- Technical fix (e.g., cache capacity or load shedding)  
- Observability improvement (e.g., add `cache_status` as metric label)  
- Culture/process improvement (e.g., runbook for tax-service caching)

---

## üõ† Capstone Artifacts (All Optional)

- Incident doc (template)  
- Postmortem doc (template)  
- PDF or Markdown submission with filled simulation exercise  
- Team debrief format (for workshops)

---

## üï≥Ô∏è Common Pitfalls (Capstone Edition)

- Focusing only on metrics and missing trace gaps  
- Blaming infra without evidence  
- Failure to identify **user impact** vs system anomaly  
- Getting lost in logs without correlation ID

---

## üìú Final Commandments (Team Edition)

üó£Ô∏è *From Hector:* ‚ÄúChaos is the real audit.‚Äù  
üó£Ô∏è *From Mina:* ‚ÄúIf the trace breaks, so does the truth.‚Äù  
üó£Ô∏è *From Felix:* ‚ÄúA burned budget isn‚Äôt a failure. It‚Äôs a signal.‚Äù  
üó£Ô∏è *From Asha:* ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll always see more with less‚Äîif it‚Äôs structured right.‚Äù
