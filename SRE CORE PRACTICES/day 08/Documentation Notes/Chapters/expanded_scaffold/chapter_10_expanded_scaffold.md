# Chapter 10: Dynamic Observability Controls

## Panel 1: The Adaptive Sampling Gateway
### Scene Description

 In a dimly lit banking operations center, a senior SRE named Maya studies multiple dashboards showing the bank's payment processing system. One dashboard displays a heat map of transaction processing times, with most areas in cool blue. A smaller screen shows a line graph of observability data volume steadily pulsing at a low level. Suddenly, a section of the heat map flashes red, indicating a spike in processing times for international wire transfers. As if responding to this change, the observability data volume graph automatically rises for that specific service, showing increased sampling rates. Maya nods with approval as the system automatically dials up telemetry collection precisely where needed.

### Teaching Narrative
Most observability implementations operate with static sampling rates that remain fixed regardless of system conditions. This "set-and-forget" approach represents a critical missed opportunity in cost-efficient observability. Dynamic observability controls implement an adaptive feedback loop that automatically modifies telemetry collection based on real-time signals from your system.

The concept operates on a simple premise: when systems are healthy and operating within normal parameters, extensive high-fidelity observability provides diminishing returns while continuing to incur full costs. Conversely, when anomalies emerge or systems approach critical thresholds, increasing observability fidelity becomes invaluable for rapid diagnosis and remediation.

Adaptive sampling represents the cornerstone of dynamic observability, where instrumentation adjusts collection rates in response to detected conditions. This requires implementing decision logic that can identify significant deviations from baseline metrics and temporarily increase sampling rates from a cost-efficient baseline (perhaps 1-5%) to a much higher rate (50-100%) for the specific components exhibiting anomalous behavior. This surgical precision in observability allows for deep visibility precisely when and where it matters most, while maintaining cost efficiency during normal operations.

### Common Example of the Problem
First National Bank's foreign exchange trading platform typically processed approximately 50,000 transactions daily, generating nearly 500GB of observability data at full collection rates. To reduce costs, they implemented a static 5% sampling rate across all services, which dramatically decreased their observability expenses but created a troubling blind spot. 

During a market volatility event, transaction volumes suddenly doubled, and failure rates increased from 0.01% to 0.5%. With only 5% sampling, many failing transactions went uncaptured in their telemetry data. The operations team had insufficient diagnostic information to quickly identify the root cause, extending their mean time to resolution from minutes to hours. This extended outage resulted in missed trading opportunities for clients and reputational damage for the bank, all while their observability system dutifully continued collecting the same low-fidelity sample that was appropriate for normal conditions but entirely inadequate for the anomaly.

### SRE Best Practice: Evidence-Based Investigation
Effective adaptive sampling requires establishing baseline metrics that accurately represent normal system behavior. By continuously analyzing statistical patterns across key performance indicators, adaptive systems can detect anomalies that warrant increased observability.

The evidence-based approach begins with multi-dimensional baseline modeling. Rather than setting simplistic thresholds on individual metrics, sophisticated detection algorithms establish correlations between related indicators. For example, transaction latency, queue depth, and error rates together provide a more reliable signal than any single metric alone.

When implementing adaptive sampling, critical investigation questions include:
1. What statistical confidence is required to trigger sampling rate adjustments?
2. Which components should increase sampling when an anomaly is detected in a related service?
3. How quickly should sampling rates decrease after conditions normalize?
4. What maximum sampling rates are economically sustainable during extended anomalies?

Leading organizations employ progressive response thresholds rather than binary triggers. As deviation from baseline increases, sampling rates escalate proportionally—perhaps from 5% during normal operation to 25% during moderate anomalies to 100% during critical deviations. This progressive approach balances cost efficiency with diagnostic needs.

Most importantly, adaptive systems must capture pre-incident data through circular buffers that temporarily retain higher-fidelity information before an anomaly is detected. This "look-back" capability ensures critical context is available even if sampling increases occur after initial symptoms appear.

### Banking Impact
The financial impacts of static versus adaptive sampling extend far beyond direct observability costs. While adaptive sampling typically reduces baseline expenditure by 60-80% compared to full-fidelity collection, the true value lies in maintaining diagnostic capability during critical incidents.

For banking systems, the business consequences manifest in several dimensions:

1. **Revenue Protection**: Payment processing outages directly impact transaction revenue. A major card issuer implementing adaptive sampling reduced their mean time to resolution by 47%, preventing an estimated $2.3M in annual lost transaction revenue.

2. **Compliance Risk**: Regulatory requirements demand explanation of system failures affecting customer funds. Adaptive sampling ensures comprehensive forensic data is available for significant incidents while avoiding the cost of perpetually storing full telemetry.

3. **Customer Retention**: Each extended outage increases customer attrition. A retail banking platform found that reducing incident resolution time through better diagnostics improved customer retention by 0.7%, representing approximately $4.5M in preserved annual revenue.

4. **Operational Efficiency**: War room costs during major incidents average $1,000 per minute for large financial institutions. By accelerating root cause analysis through targeted high-fidelity data, adaptive sampling directly reduces these costs.

The most compelling banking impact manifests through improved availability metrics. A global payment processor implementing adaptive sampling improved their 99.95% availability to 99.99%, representing a reduction from approximately 22 minutes of downtime monthly to just 4 minutes—a critical difference for time-sensitive financial transactions.

### Implementation Guidance
To implement effective adaptive sampling in banking environments, follow these five actionable steps:

1. **Establish Service-Specific Baselines**: 
   - Analyze at least 30 days of historical telemetry to establish normal patterns
   - Identify key performance indicators specific to each banking service (transaction latency, authorization rates, queue depths)
   - Calculate statistical variance patterns under different business conditions (market open/close, month-end processing)
   - Document baseline metrics with acceptable deviation ranges for each service

2. **Implement Multi-Level Sampling Configurations**:
   - Configure default low sampling rates (1-5%) for normal operating conditions
   - Define intermediate sampling tiers (10-25%) for moderate anomalies
   - Establish emergency sampling configurations (50-100%) for critical incidents
   - Create service-specific configurations that reflect different risk profiles (higher baseline sampling for payment services than reporting systems)

3. **Develop Anomaly Detection Logic**:
   - Implement statistical algorithms to detect deviations from established baselines
   - Create correlation rules that recognize patterns across multiple metrics
   - Configure sensitivity thresholds appropriate for different services
   - Establish voting systems that require multiple indicators before triggering sampling changes

4. **Deploy Instrumentation Control Mechanisms**:
   - Implement centralized sampling configuration services that can push rate changes to agents
   - Develop communication protocols that propagate sampling decisions across service boundaries
   - Create override mechanisms that allow manual control during incident response
   - Establish rate-limiting guardrails that prevent runaway data collection even during incidents

5. **Establish Feedback and Optimization Loops**:
   - Implement post-incident reviews that evaluate sampling effectiveness during anomalies
   - Create metrics that track false positive and false negative rates for sampling adjustments
   - Continuously refine baseline models as system behavior evolves
   - Develop ROI tracking that quantifies both cost savings and incident impact reduction


## Panel 2: The Anomaly Response Circuit
### Scene Description

 A team of SREs is gathered in a war room during an incident. Multiple screens show a trading platform experiencing unusual patterns. A central dashboard displays the "Anomaly Response Circuit" in action - a visual flowchart showing how the system detected unusual CPU utilization patterns in the order-matching engine, automatically increased metric collection frequency from 15-second to 1-second intervals, and initiated distributed tracing at 75% sampling for all transactions touching that component. One SRE points to a visualization showing how the additional data is already forming clear patterns, while a small counter in the corner shows the temporary increase in observability costs, currently at just 0.4% of daily budget.

### Teaching Narrative
The Anomaly Response Circuit implements the technical architecture required for dynamic observability systems to function autonomously. Unlike traditional static observability, where human operators must manually enable additional debugging, these circuits create automated feedback mechanisms that can respond to system conditions faster than any human intervention.

The core of this pattern involves three essential components: sensors, decision logic, and actuation mechanisms. Sensors continuously monitor key health indicators across your architecture, looking for deviations from established baselines. The decision logic applies statistical analysis and anomaly detection algorithms to these signals, determining when unusual patterns warrant increased observability. Finally, actuation mechanisms modify instrumentation configurations in real-time to implement sampling rate changes, logging level adjustments, or trace collection modifications.

This approach fundamentally changes observability from a passive monitoring system to an active participant in incident response. By implementing tiered response thresholds, observability intensity can scale proportionally to detected anomaly severity. Most importantly, these circuits operate with strict guardrails that prevent runaway costs - implementing circuit breakers that limit maximum observability expenditure and ensuring automatic reversion to baseline collection after anomalies resolve or predetermined time windows expire.

### Common Example of the Problem
Global Investment Bank's algorithmic trading platform typically operated with minimal instrumentation to optimize performance. Their standard observability configuration captured high-level metrics at 30-second intervals with just 2% of transactions traced to control costs and minimize performance impact. While adequate for normal operations, this approach created a critical diagnostic gap during anomalous conditions.

During a recent market volatility event, their trading algorithms began executing unexpected trade patterns, but the sparse telemetry provided insufficient insight into the algorithm's decision-making process. By the time engineers manually increased logging verbosity and trace sampling, the anomalous behavior had been active for nearly 15 minutes. In those minutes, the system had executed trades resulting in approximately $3.2M in unexpected positions. The lack of automatic observability adaptation delayed their understanding of the root cause and extended the impact window of the anomaly.

### SRE Best Practice: Evidence-Based Investigation
Implementing effective anomaly response circuits requires sophisticated sensor networks that can detect subtle shifts in system behavior before they become major incidents. Best practices for these detection mechanisms include:

1. **Multi-Modal Detection**: Combine multiple detection approaches rather than relying on simple thresholds:
   - Statistical deviation models that identify values outside normal distribution
   - Trend analysis that detects unusual rate-of-change patterns
   - Correlation detectors that identify unexpected relationships between metrics
   - Pattern recognition for seasonal and cyclical variations in financial systems

2. **Tiered Response Framework**: Implement graduated responses proportional to anomaly severity:
   - Initial detection triggers modest observability increases (higher metric frequency, low sampling)
   - Continued or worsening anomalies escalate to more aggressive collection
   - Specific patterns associated with known high-risk scenarios trigger immediate maximum visibility

3. **Differentiated Detection Sensitivity**: Adjust detection thresholds based on business criticality:
   - Lower thresholds (more sensitive) for payment processing and trading systems
   - Standard thresholds for account management and reporting services
   - Higher thresholds (less sensitive) for batch processing and analytics workloads

4. **Time-Aware Contextualization**: Incorporate business timing into anomaly detection:
   - Different baseline comparisons for market open/close periods
   - Adjusted expectations during known high-volume periods like month-end
   - Special detection rules during maintenance or deployment windows

The most sophisticated anomaly circuits incorporate machine learning models that continuously improve detection accuracy by analyzing historical incident patterns and their precursor signals. These systems develop increasingly accurate "fingerprints" of developing problems, enabling earlier detection and more targeted observability responses.

### Banking Impact
For financial institutions, the business impact of automated anomaly response circuits extends far beyond operational efficiency. The most significant business value comes from:

1. **Trading Loss Prevention**: For investment banks and trading platforms, algorithm anomalies can cause substantial financial losses within minutes. A major trading firm implemented automated observability circuits that reduced anomaly detection time by 82%, directly preventing an estimated $14M in annual trading losses.

2. **Fraud Detection Acceleration**: Transaction fraud patterns often manifest subtly before large-scale attacks. Dynamic observability enables earlier pattern recognition, with one payment processor documenting a 34% improvement in early fraud detection after implementing automated observability adaptation.

3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Financial regulators increasingly require evidence of adequate system monitoring and timely incident response. Automated observability circuits provide documented evidence of sophisticated monitoring practices, reducing compliance findings by up to 60% in regulated trading environments.

4. **Customer Experience Protection**: Service degradations often begin subtly before causing customer-visible impact. Retail banking platforms implementing dynamic observability reported a 42% reduction in customer-impacting incidents through earlier detection and resolution of emerging issues.

The economic case for anomaly response circuits becomes compelling when quantifying the full business impact. A global bank calculated their return on investment at approximately 840% annually, with benefits primarily derived from prevented losses rather than direct cost savings on observability infrastructure.

### Implementation Guidance
To implement effective anomaly response circuits in banking environments, follow these five actionable steps:

1. **Design the Sensor Network**:
   - Identify critical health indicators specific to each banking service type
   - Implement baseline metrics that cover the "Four Golden Signals" (latency, traffic, errors, saturation)
   - Add domain-specific signals such as transaction success rates, authentication failures, and database performance
   - Ensure sensor coverage across all system layers from infrastructure to business transactions
   - Deploy sensors with minimal performance impact during normal operation

2. **Develop Detection Algorithms**:
   - Implement statistical models appropriate for different metric types (moving averages, standard deviation, percentile-based)
   - Create correlation detectors that identify unusual relationships between metrics
   - Develop pattern recognition for typical banking anomaly patterns
   - Train machine learning models using historical incident data where available
   - Test algorithm sensitivity using historical anomalies to validate detection capability

3. **Design the Decision Engine**:
   - Create a rules engine that translates detected anomalies into observability actions
   - Implement a scoring system that combines multiple weak signals into strong action triggers
   - Define appropriate response tiers for different anomaly types and severities
   - Build in fail-safes that prevent excessive data collection regardless of detected conditions
   - Include manual override capabilities for incident response teams

4. **Implement Actuation Mechanisms**:
   - Deploy configurable instrumentation that can adjust collection parameters in real-time
   - Create centralized configuration services that can push changes to distributed components
   - Implement agent-based control systems within each application environment
   - Develop sampling coordination services that maintain consistency across service boundaries
   - Build telemetry pipelines that can dynamically scale to handle increased data volumes

5. **Establish Operational Governance**:
   - Create dashboards that provide visibility into circuit operation and current state
   - Implement automatic notification when circuits activate increased observability
   - Develop cost tracking specific to dynamic collection increases
   - Establish regular review cycles to evaluate and tune circuit performance
   - Create documentation procedures to capture activation patterns for post-incident analysis


## Panel 3: The Criticality-Based Telemetry Matrix
### Scene Description

 In a modern banking technology workspace, a whiteboard shows a complex matrix diagram. The vertical axis lists various banking services (Payments, Authentication, Account Services, Trading, etc.), while the horizontal axis shows different system conditions (Normal, Degraded, Critical, Incident). Within each cell of this matrix are specific observability parameters - sampling rates, log levels, and metrics collection frequencies. An SRE is explaining to colleagues how their newly implemented system automatically transitions between these collection profiles based on service health, pointing to a real-time dashboard that shows most services in "Normal" state with minimal telemetry collection, except for Authentication which has automatically shifted to "Degraded" state with enhanced observability.

### Teaching Narrative
The Criticality-Based Telemetry Matrix represents a structured approach to implementing dynamic observability controls that recognize not all systems have equal importance or identical observability needs. This model creates a multidimensional framework for automated telemetry adjustments based on both the business criticality of a service and its current operational state.

The fundamental insight behind this pattern is that observability strategies should be contextually aware - a minor anomaly in a critical payment processing service may warrant more aggressive observability than a significant deviation in a non-customer-facing batch process. By mapping each service to its business criticality and defining appropriate observability profiles for different health states, organizations implement nuanced collection strategies that balance visibility and cost.

Implementation requires defining service tiers based on business impact, establishing clear health state definitions with measurable thresholds, and creating corresponding observability profiles with specific instrumentation parameters. The resulting matrix creates a deterministic system that automatically implements the right observability intensity for each service's current circumstances. This approach ensures critical systems always receive appropriate visibility while preventing observability resources from being wasted on less important components experiencing minor variations.

### Common Example of the Problem
Regional Community Bank implemented a modern observability platform during their digital transformation initiative. Following initial deployment, they applied uniform instrumentation across all systems - from their online banking platform to internal reporting tools. This one-size-fits-all approach resulted in excessive observability costs while still missing critical insights where they mattered most.

During a recent incident, their authentication service began experiencing intermittent failures affecting customer logins. Despite extensive telemetry collection across all systems, the relatively low sampling rate (5%) applied uniformly meant that many authentication failures went uncaptured, making pattern identification difficult. Meanwhile, their internal report generation system was being monitored at the same fidelity despite having minimal business impact when delayed. The result was a paradoxical situation where they simultaneously collected too much data overall while having insufficient visibility into the services that directly impacted customers and revenue.

### SRE Best Practice: Evidence-Based Investigation
Developing an effective criticality-based telemetry matrix requires systematic analysis of both service importance and observability needs:

1. **Service Criticality Classification**: Evaluate each service against objective business impact criteria:
   - Direct revenue impact (payment processing, trading engines)
   - Customer experience impact (login services, mobile app backends)
   - Regulatory compliance requirements (transaction recording, audit systems)
   - Operational dependencies (services that many other systems depend on)
   - Recovery time objectives established in business continuity plans

2. **Health State Definition**: Establish clear, measurable definitions for different operational states:
   - Normal: All KPIs within expected ranges
   - Degraded: Performance metrics showing deviation but without customer impact
   - Critical: Customer-impacting performance issues or elevated error rates
   - Incident: Confirmed service disruption with significant business impact

3. **Appropriate Observability Mapping**: Determine appropriate telemetry parameters for each service-state combination:
   - Metrics collection frequency (15s, 10s, 5s, 1s intervals)
   - Log verbosity levels (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG)
   - Distributed tracing sampling rates (1%, 10%, 50%, 100%)
   - Retention periods for collected telemetry
   - Custom instrumentation activation (e.g., database query capturing)

4. **Transition Trigger Definition**: Establish evidence-based triggers for state transitions:
   - Statistical thresholds derived from historical performance
   - Multi-signal triggers that require confirmation across related metrics
   - Duration-based qualifiers that prevent state flapping
   - Business-hour sensitive thresholds that reflect different expectations

The most sophisticated implementations incorporate feedback loops that evaluate the effectiveness of different observability profiles during actual incidents. For example, if post-incident analysis reveals that a 10% sampling rate was insufficient to diagnose a particular failure mode, the matrix can be automatically updated to increase sampling for that specific pattern in the future.

### Banking Impact
The business impact of implementing a criticality-based telemetry matrix extends beyond direct cost optimization:

1. **Aligned Observability Investment**: One global bank documented a 32% reduction in overall observability costs while simultaneously increasing telemetry collection for their most critical payment services. This optimization represented approximately $1.7M in annual savings while improving visibility where it delivered the most business value.

2. **Reduced Mean Time to Resolution**: By ensuring critical services receive appropriate observability during degraded conditions, financial institutions report significant improvements in incident resolution times. A mortgage processing platform documented a 57% reduction in MTTR after implementing criticality-based telemetry, directly improving customer experience during system issues.

3. **Regulatory Compliance Efficiency**: Banking regulators require comprehensive monitoring of customer-affecting services. The matrix approach allows institutions to demonstrate appropriate monitoring of regulated services while optimizing costs for non-regulated components. One bank reduced audit findings related to insufficient monitoring by 83% while simultaneously reducing observability costs.

4. **Scalable Observability Economics**: As financial institutions grow, observability costs traditionally scaled linearly or exponentially with transaction volume. The tiered matrix approach creates sub-linear cost scaling by increasing efficiency. A rapidly growing fintech documented that transaction volume grew 215% year-over-year while observability costs increased only 40% through matrix-based efficiency.

Beyond these tangible impacts, the matrix approach fundamentally changes how organizations view observability - transforming it from a technical overhead cost to a strategically allocated investment aligned with business priorities.

### Implementation Guidance
To implement an effective criticality-based telemetry matrix in banking environments, follow these five actionable steps:

1. **Conduct Service Criticality Assessment**:
   - Create an inventory of all services in your banking environment
   - Establish objective criticality criteria (revenue impact, customer visibility, regulatory requirements)
   - Assemble cross-functional teams including business stakeholders to assess each service
   - Assign services to criticality tiers (typically 3-5 levels from most to least critical)
   - Document rationale for each classification and review quarterly

2. **Define Health States and Transitions**:
   - Establish clear metric-based definitions for each operational state (Normal, Degraded, Critical, Incident)
   - Create specific thresholds appropriate to each service based on historical performance
   - Define required duration of threshold violations to trigger state changes (avoid flapping)
   - Implement different thresholds for business hours versus off-hours where appropriate
   - Document state definitions in a central knowledge base accessible to all teams

3. **Design Observability Profiles**:
   - For each combination of service tier and health state, define specific observability parameters
   - Create standard profiles that specify metrics frequency, log levels, and sampling rates
   - Document retention periods appropriate for different data types and services
   - Establish maximum cost parameters for each profile to prevent budget overruns
   - Validate profiles with SRE and application teams to ensure they meet diagnostic needs

4. **Implement Technical Controls**:
   - Develop or configure a central observability controller that can adjust instrumentation dynamically
   - Create service-specific agents or configuration endpoints that respond to profile changes
   - Implement automated state detection based on your defined thresholds
   - Develop configuration APIs that enable both automated and manual profile switching
   - Build safeguards that prevent simultaneous high-intensity collection across too many services

5. **Establish Governance and Optimization**:
   - Create dashboards showing current state and observability profile for each service
   - Implement alerting for state transitions to notify appropriate teams
   - Develop cost tracking and attribution specific to dynamic profile changes
   - Establish a regular review cycle to evaluate profile effectiveness during incidents
   - Create a structured process to update the matrix based on incident learnings


## Panel 4: The Feedback-Driven Learning Loop
### Scene Description

 A retrospective meeting following a major incident at a global bank. On a large screen, two SREs are presenting a visualization of how their dynamic observability system performed during the incident. The diagram shows a timeline where initial anomaly detection triggered increased telemetry collection, but in one subsystem, the sampling rate increase came too late to capture the root cause. The screen transitions to show how the system has now updated its anomaly detection thresholds based on this experience, with machine learning algorithms refining the signals that trigger enhanced collection. A simulation replay demonstrates how the adjusted system would have increased sampling rates 47 seconds earlier, potentially reducing incident resolution time significantly.

### Teaching Narrative
The most sophisticated dynamic observability systems incorporate feedback-driven learning loops that continuously improve their anomaly detection and response capabilities. Unlike static rules-based approaches, these systems evolve through both machine learning algorithms and human feedback integration to become increasingly effective at balancing visibility and cost.

This pattern implements a meta-observability layer that monitors the performance of the observability system itself. It collects data on key questions: Did increased sampling start early enough to capture root causes? Did collection remain elevated longer than necessary? Were the right components targeted for enhanced visibility? By analyzing these outcomes, the system gradually refines its decision models to more accurately identify when and where to adjust telemetry collection.

The implementation combines statistical analysis of historical incident data with machine learning algorithms that identify subtle precursor patterns that human operators might miss. Additionally, integration with post-incident reviews allows SREs to provide direct feedback on observability performance, creating both automated and human-guided improvement mechanisms. Over time, these learning loops dramatically increase the precision of dynamic observability controls, ensuring that costly high-fidelity data collection activates exactly when needed - not too early (wasting resources) and not too late (missing critical diagnostic information).

### Common Example of the Problem
Investment Banking Division at a major financial institution implemented dynamic observability for their trading platform, using rule-based anomaly detection to trigger increased telemetry collection during potential incidents. While generally effective, their system suffered from static thresholds that failed to adapt to evolving system behavior.

During a recent high-volatility trading session, their order matching engine experienced subtle performance degradation that eventually cascaded into a significant outage. Their anomaly detection rules, based on historical patterns, failed to identify the early warning signs of this new failure mode. By the time thresholds were breached and enhanced telemetry activated, the system was already in a critical state. Post-incident analysis revealed that unusual memory allocation patterns preceded the outage by nearly 3 minutes, but these patterns weren't part of the static ruleset triggering observability adjustments. The result was insufficient diagnostic data during the critical early stages of the incident, extending resolution time and increasing trading impact.

### SRE Best Practice: Evidence-Based Investigation
Implementing effective feedback-driven learning requires systematic approach to evaluating and improving observability effectiveness:

1. **Meta-Instrumentation Implementation**: Instrument the observability system itself to collect key performance indicators:
   - Timing of anomaly detection relative to incident declaration
   - False positive and false negative rates for anomaly triggers
   - Coverage metrics showing what percentage of actual incidents had enhanced observability
   - Precision metrics indicating whether the right services received increased telemetry
   - Cost efficiency measurements comparing increased collection expense to incident impact

2. **Post-Incident Observability Analysis**: Systematically evaluate observability performance in every incident:
   - Determine whether sufficient telemetry was available for efficient diagnosis
   - Identify potential precursor signals that could have triggered earlier collection
   - Analyze whether the right components received enhanced visibility
   - Evaluate if collection remained elevated longer than necessary after resolution
   - Document specific observability gaps that hindered investigation

3. **Pattern Library Development**: Build a growing catalog of anomaly signatures:
   - Maintain a database of known failure modes and their telemetry signatures
   - Document the most reliable early indicator metrics for different types of incidents
   - Record the observability parameters most valuable for diagnosing each failure type
   - Capture the propagation patterns showing how issues spread between services
   - Update this library after each significant incident with new patterns

4. **Continuous Threshold Refinement**: Systematically adjust detection sensitivity:
   - Implement automated A/B testing of different threshold configurations
   - Regularly analyze false positive and negative rates to optimize triggers
   - Adjust detection parameters based on seasonal patterns in financial systems
   - Implement progressive learning that increases accuracy over time
   - Develop service-specific refinements rather than system-wide adjustments

The most sophisticated approaches incorporate both machine learning models and human expert feedback. While algorithms excel at identifying subtle patterns in large datasets, experienced SREs often recognize nuanced system behaviors that algorithms might miss. The combination creates a powerful hybrid approach that continuously improves detection accuracy.

### Banking Impact
The business impact of feedback-driven observability optimization extends beyond operational improvements to directly affect financial outcomes:

1. **Incident Prevention Acceleration**: As learning loops improve early detection, many potential incidents are resolved before customer impact occurs. One investment bank documented a 37% reduction in customer-impacting incidents after implementing feedback-driven observability optimization, representing approximately $12.8M in prevented trading losses.

2. **Resolution Time Compression**: When incidents do occur, earlier and more precise telemetry collection accelerates diagnosis. A retail banking platform reduced mean time to resolution by 61% through optimized observability triggering, minimizing the customer impact window for service disruptions.

3. **Operational Efficiency**: Reduced false positives mean fewer unnecessary elevated collection periods. One financial institution documented 83% fewer false alarms after six months of feedback-driven optimization, reducing both observability costs and engineering distraction.

4. **Root Cause Identification**: More precise observability targeting leads to more definitive root cause analysis. A payment processor improved their root cause identification rate from 73% to 94% after implementing learning loops, enabling more effective permanent fixes rather than symptomatic mitigations.

The cumulative business effect is particularly powerful. As precision increases, institutions can afford to implement more aggressive early detection with lower thresholds, creating a virtuous cycle of ever-improving incident prevention and resolution without corresponding cost increases.

### Implementation Guidance
To implement effective feedback-driven learning for dynamic observability in banking environments, follow these five actionable steps:

1. **Establish Observability Performance Metrics**:
   - Define clear KPIs for measuring observability system effectiveness
   - Implement tracking for anomaly detection timing relative to incidents
   - Create dashboards showing false positive and negative rates over time
   - Develop cost efficiency metrics connecting observability expense to incident impact
   - Establish baseline measurements before implementing learning mechanisms

2. **Integrate with Incident Management**:
   - Modify incident post-mortem templates to include observability effectiveness questions
   - Create structured feedback mechanisms for SREs to rate telemetry quality during incidents
   - Implement systematic tagging of incidents with observability gap information
   - Develop processes to extract observability learnings from each significant incident
   - Establish regular reviews focused specifically on observability performance

3. **Implement Pattern Recognition Systems**:
   - Deploy machine learning models trained on historical incident telemetry
   - Create a growing database of failure signatures with their precursor patterns
   - Develop similarity detection to identify variations of known issues
   - Implement seasonal pattern awareness for banking-specific cycles
   - Build correlation detection to identify relationships between seemingly unrelated metrics

4. **Develop Adaptive Threshold Management**:
   - Create mechanisms to automatically adjust detection thresholds based on performance
   - Implement A/B testing for different sensitivity configurations
   - Develop service-specific threshold optimization rather than global adjustments
   - Build time-aware threshold management for different business periods
   - Implement progressive learning that improves precision over time

5. **Establish Continuous Improvement Cycles**:
   - Schedule regular reviews of observability system performance
   - Create clear ownership for observability effectiveness
   - Implement version control for detection configurations to track changes
   - Develop simulation capabilities to test detection improvements against historical incidents
   - Establish metrics showing learning progress over time


## Panel 5: The Cost-Aware Circuit Breaker
### Scene Description

 In a financial technology department, an alert suddenly appears on an SRE's monitor. The screen shows that the dynamic observability system for a loan processing application has triggered an automatic circuit breaker. A visualization shows how an unusual pattern in database queries caused the system to progressively increase telemetry collection, but when costs exceeded predefined thresholds, safety mechanisms automatically intervened. The SRE examines a control panel that shows the circuit breaker has reverted collection to baseline levels except for specific critical paths. A notification indicates that engineering management approval is required to override these cost protection mechanisms during the current billing cycle.

### Teaching Narrative
Even the most sophisticated dynamic observability systems require protection against unexpected cost escalation. The Cost-Aware Circuit Breaker pattern implements essential guardrails that prevent runaway observability expenses while maintaining visibility for truly critical situations.

This pattern operates on the principle that observability systems should have self-protective mechanisms similar to how electrical circuit breakers prevent damage from power surges. Without these controls, an unusual system state or misconfiguration could trigger expensive high-fidelity data collection across too many components or for extended periods, potentially causing significant budget overruns.

Implementation requires establishing multi-level cost thresholds with progressively restrictive interventions. Initial thresholds might trigger alerts while allowing continued dynamic adjustments, while higher thresholds implement automatic collection throttling for non-critical components. The most severe thresholds force system-wide reversion to baseline collection rates with manual override requirements. These circuit breakers typically operate on daily, weekly, and monthly cost accumulation timeframes, providing protection at different organizational budgeting levels. Additionally, differential circuit breakers can be implemented across service criticality tiers, ensuring business-critical systems retain necessary visibility even during cost-containment interventions.

### Common Example of the Problem
Multinational Bank's capital markets division implemented dynamic observability across their trading platforms without adequate cost controls. The system successfully detected anomalies and increased telemetry collection as designed, but lacked safeguards against prolonged or widespread collection increases.

During an unusual market event, their systems detected anomalies across multiple trading services simultaneously. The dynamic observability system responded correctly by increasing sampling rates, trace collection, and log verbosity across all affected components. However, what initially appeared to be a temporary condition persisted for nearly 18 hours due to unusual market volatility. Throughout this extended period, the observability system continued collecting at maximum fidelity across dozens of services, generating over 15TB of telemetry data—nearly 20 times normal volume.

When the monthly observability bill arrived, the capital markets division had exceeded their budget by 340%, creating significant financial and political consequences within the organization. Worse, much of the collected data provided minimal diagnostic value after the initial investigation hours, representing wasted resources that could have been avoided with proper circuit breaker implementations.

### SRE Best Practice: Evidence-Based Investigation
Implementing effective cost-aware circuit breakers requires sophisticated analysis of both technical needs and economic constraints:

1. **Multi-Dimensional Cost Modeling**: Develop comprehensive understanding of observability economics:
   - Analyze historical telemetry generation patterns across different service states
   - Model the cost impact of different collection strategies per service
   - Understand the consumption-based pricing models of your observability platforms
   - Identify which observability dimensions (cardinality, volume, retention) drive the majority of costs
   - Create predictive models for how costs scale during different types of incidents

2. **Tiered Threshold Implementation**: Establish progressive intervention levels:
   - Define "normal" cost envelopes for different time periods (daily, weekly, monthly)
   - Create alert thresholds at 50-70% of maximum acceptable cost
   - Implement "soft intervention" thresholds at 70-85% that begin restricting non-critical collection
   - Establish "hard circuit breaker" thresholds at 85-95% that implement strict controls
   - Define emergency override procedures for legitimate business-critical needs

3. **Differential Service Protection**: Implement criticality-aware cost controls:
   - Create different circuit breaker thresholds for different service criticality tiers
   - Establish protection hierarchies that maintain visibility for revenue-critical services
   - Implement more aggressive cost controls for non-customer-facing components
   - Define essential "always-on" telemetry that remains active regardless of cost state
   - Create critical path identification that preserves transaction visibility while limiting peripheral data

4. **Intelligent Intervention Design**: Develop nuanced control mechanisms:
   - Implement progressive sampling rate reductions rather than binary on/off switches
   - Create dimension reduction that maintains core metrics while eliminating high-cardinality labels
   - Develop retention period adjustments that move data to cold storage rather than discarding it
   - Implement query governor mechanisms that limit expensive analytical operations
   - Create user awareness of cost states to encourage voluntary conservation

The most sophisticated circuit breaker implementations incorporate situational awareness. For example, during trading hours, circuit breakers might allow higher cost tolerance for trading platforms while imposing stricter limits on back-office systems. Conversely, during overnight batch processing, the priorities might reverse to provide deeper visibility into settlement processes.

### Banking Impact
The business impact of implementing cost-aware circuit breakers extends beyond simple cost control:

1. **Budget Predictability**: Without circuit breakers, observability costs can spike unexpectedly during unusual conditions. One investment bank experienced a 570% monthly cost overrun before implementing circuit breakers. After implementation, even their worst month remained within 15% of budget projections, creating financial predictability crucial for technology budget management.

2. **Sustained Visibility**: Paradoxically, circuit breakers often improve overall visibility by preventing situations where excessive collection must be abruptly disabled due to runaway costs. A commercial banking platform documented that implementing progressive circuit breakers reduced their "observability blackout" incidents by 94%, where previously they had to completely disable collection during cost overruns.

3. **Trust in Dynamic Systems**: Organizations without cost controls often reject dynamic observability entirely after experiencing budget shocks. A payment processor that implemented circuit breakers from the beginning reported 92% higher adoption of advanced observability practices compared to peer organizations that experienced unconstrained cost events.

4. **Operational Sustainability**: Excessive telemetry collection can impact system performance. Circuit breakers protect not just costs but system health during unusual conditions. One bank documented that circuit breakers prevented a cascading failure where observability overhead was exacerbating an already stressed system during a high-volume trading event.

Beyond these direct impacts, well-designed circuit breakers fundamentally change organizational psychology around observability. Rather than viewing it as an unpredictable expense that might spiral out of control, teams see it as a managed investment with appropriate governance—increasing willingness to implement sophisticated observability practices.

### Implementation Guidance
To implement effective cost-aware circuit breakers in banking environments, follow these five actionable steps:

1. **Analyze Cost Drivers and Establish Baseline**:
   - Collect at least 90 days of observability cost data to establish patterns
   - Identify which components and services drive the majority of expenses
   - Analyze how costs have scaled during previous incidents
   - Establish cost variability patterns across different business cycles
   - Create "normal operating envelope" definitions for different time periods

2. **Design Multi-Tiered Threshold Framework**:
   - Define clear threshold tiers as percentages of budget limits
   - Create appropriate time windows for different thresholds (daily, weekly, monthly)
   - Establish different threshold levels for different services based on criticality
   - Document intervention actions appropriate for each threshold breach
   - Create approval processes for threshold overrides during legitimate incidents

3. **Implement Progressive Intervention Controls**:
   - Develop notification systems that alert appropriate teams when approaching thresholds
   - Create automated actions that reduce collection fidelity as thresholds are crossed
   - Implement service prioritization that protects critical visibility while restricting peripheral data
   - Develop administrative interfaces for manual control during incidents
   - Create rollback mechanisms that can restore normal collection when costs stabilize

4. **Establish Governance Framework**:
   - Define clear ownership for observability cost management
   - Create structured exception processes for legitimate threshold overrides
   - Implement post-threshold-event reviews to evaluate intervention effectiveness

   - Establish regular review cycles to adjust thresholds based on changing business needs

5. **Create Feedback and Optimization Mechanisms**:
   - Implement monitoring of circuit breaker effectiveness
   - Develop metrics tracking cost savings versus visibility impact
   - Create processes to adjust thresholds based on operational experience
   - Establish regular tests of circuit breaker mechanisms to ensure proper function
   - Implement continuous improvement through post-activation reviews


## Panel 6: The Predictive Scaling Sensor
### Scene Description

 In the operations center of a major international bank, a calendar display shows the upcoming end-of-month financial close period. On a nearby screen, a predictive observability dashboard shows a forecast of anticipated system load across various banking services for the next 72 hours. As the visualization plays forward, it demonstrates how the observability system will proactively adjust sampling strategies before peak periods even begin - increasing collection capacity for known-critical payment reconciliation systems while reducing sampling in non-essential services. A cost projection graph shows how this predictive adjustment is expected to maintain total observability costs within budget while maximizing visibility for the most business-critical transaction flows during the high-volume period.

### Teaching Narrative
While reactive dynamic observability responds to emerging conditions, truly sophisticated systems incorporate predictive capabilities that anticipate changing observability needs before they occur. The Predictive Scaling Sensor pattern leverages historical patterns, scheduled events, and business intelligence to proactively optimize observability resources.

This approach recognizes that many system behaviors follow predictable patterns aligned with business cycles - month-end processing, trading market opens, holiday shopping seasons, or planned deployments. Rather than waiting for anomalies to emerge during these known high-stress periods, predictive systems preemptively adjust observability strategies to optimize visibility where and when it will most likely be needed.

Implementation combines time-series analysis of historical system behavior with calendar-aware scheduling and integration with business event feeds. Machine learning algorithms identify cyclical patterns in system performance and correlate them with past incidents to create probabilistic forecasts of where observability resources will deliver maximum value. This proactive approach is particularly valuable in banking environments where many critical processes follow predictable schedules, allowing organizations to shift from purely reactive to strategically proactive observability resource allocation while maintaining strict cost controls.

### Common Example of the Problem
Global payments provider historically relied on reactive observability adjustments, only increasing telemetry collection after detecting anomalies or receiving customer complaints. This approach left them perpetually one step behind during predictable high-stress periods.

During monthly credit card statement processing cycles, their transaction authorization system regularly experienced performance degradation as batch processes competed with real-time authorizations for database resources. Despite this pattern repeating monthly, their observability system treated each occurrence as a new anomaly, only increasing telemetry collection after performance metrics deteriorated. This reactive approach consistently delayed problem diagnosis by 15-20 minutes while waiting for the system to recognize the anomaly and enhance data collection.

Additionally, the sudden increase in telemetry collection during these already high-stress periods created additional system load, sometimes exacerbating the very problems they were trying to diagnose. The result was extended resolution times, unnecessary customer impact, and inefficient use of observability resources that could have been optimally provisioned in advance.

### SRE Best Practice: Evidence-Based Investigation
Implementing effective predictive observability requires sophisticated analysis of historical patterns combined with forward-looking business intelligence:

1. **Pattern Recognition and Classification**: Analyze historical system behavior to identify predictable patterns:
   - Perform time-series decomposition to identify daily, weekly, and monthly cycles
   - Correlate system performance patterns with business calendar events
   - Identify recurring stress periods that correspond to known business processes
   - Classify pattern types based on their observability requirements
   - Create pattern fingerprints that enable future recognition

2. **Business Calendar Integration**: Incorporate business event data into observability planning:
   - Create integrations with corporate calendars to identify planned activities
   - Develop awareness of financial reporting and closing schedules
   - Incorporate trading market schedules and anticipated volatility events
   - Track promotional activities that might drive unusual customer behavior
   - Include planned maintenance and release schedules

3. **Predictive Resource Allocation**: Develop forward-looking observability plans:
   - Create forecast models for system load and potential issues for upcoming events
   - Design appropriate observability profiles for different anticipated conditions
   - Develop resource allocation plans that optimize visibility during critical periods
   - Implement pre-warming strategies for observability infrastructure
   - Create load-shedding plans for non-critical telemetry during peak periods

4. **Continuous Forecast Refinement**: Implement feedback loops that improve prediction accuracy:
   - Capture actual outcomes versus forecasts for continuous model improvement
   - Calculate prediction accuracy metrics to track forecasting performance
   - Incorporate manual adjustments from experienced operators when automated systems miss patterns
   - Implement progressive learning that improves accuracy over time
   - Develop anomaly detection for unusual deviations from expected patterns

The most sophisticated implementations combine multiple prediction models, each specializing in different pattern types. Time-series forecasting excels at regular cyclical patterns, while machine learning models might better predict complex interactions between multiple factors. Calendar-based models handle scheduled events, while anomaly detection identifies unexpected deviations from predictions. The ensemble approach provides comprehensive prediction coverage across different scenarios.

### Banking Impact
The business impact of predictive observability extends beyond technical efficiency to create significant business value:

1. **Proactive Issue Prevention**: By anticipating high-stress periods and potential failure modes, organizations can often prevent issues entirely. A credit card processor implementing predictive observability reported a 47% reduction in month-end processing incidents by proactively identifying and addressing emerging issues before they impacted customers.

2. **Optimized Staffing**: Predictive observability enables more efficient on-call resource allocation. One investment bank used forecast data to adjust SRE scheduling, ensuring their most experienced engineers were available during predicted high-risk periods. This resulted in 34% faster incident resolution times and significantly reduced overtime costs.

3. **Enhanced Customer Experience**: For external-facing banking services, predictive capabilities translate directly to improved customer satisfaction. A retail banking platform documented a 28% reduction in mobile banking issues during predicted high-traffic periods after implementing predictive observability adjustments.

4. **Risk Reduction During Critical Periods**: Financial institutions often have "change freezes" during critical business periods like quarter-end. Predictive observability provides an additional risk management layer during these sensitive times. One bank reported zero critical incidents during fiscal year closing periods after implementing predictive capabilities, compared to an average of 2.3 incidents during previous closings.

Beyond these immediate benefits, predictive observability transforms how financial institutions view system management—shifting from a reactive "break-fix" mindset to a proactive reliability engineering approach that anticipates and prevents issues before they impact business operations.

   - Create documentation capturing the relationship between business events and system behavior


## Panel 7: The Cross-Service Propagation Network
### Scene Description

 A visualization shows a complex banking architecture with dozens of interconnected microservices handling different aspects of customer transactions. As a performance degradation appears in the payment gateway service, the observability system doesn't just increase telemetry collection there - it intelligently propagates enhanced collection to upstream authentication services and downstream settlement systems, creating a dynamic observability bubble that follows the transaction flow. Monitors show how sampling rates automatically increase across this service pathway while remaining at baseline levels for unrelated components. An SRE examines the resulting trace data, which has captured the complete transaction journey at high fidelity exactly where needed, revealing that while the symptom appeared in the payment gateway, the root cause lies in a database connection issue in the settlement service.

### Teaching Narrative
Modern banking systems involve complex service interactions where issues in one component often manifest as symptoms in completely different services. The Cross-Service Propagation Network implements sophisticated topology-aware dynamic observability that automatically extends enhanced telemetry collection across service boundaries to capture the complete picture of distributed transactions.

This pattern operates on the understanding that effective troubleshooting requires context beyond the immediately affected component. When anomalies are detected in one service, this approach leverages service dependency maps and request flow data to automatically propagate increased observability to upstream and downstream dependencies. This creates a dynamic "observability bubble" that follows the actual transaction paths through the system.

Implementation requires maintaining accurate service topology maps with dependency relationships, implementing distributed context propagation through trace headers or correlation IDs, and creating coordination mechanisms that allow observability decisions to propagate across service boundaries. The resulting system creates temporary high-fidelity observability corridors that follow actual transaction flows, enabling the capture of complete diagnostic information across service boundaries while maintaining overall cost efficiency by keeping unrelated services at baseline collection levels.

This approach transforms observability from a collection of isolated service-specific implementations into a coordinated network that can adapt holistically to emerging conditions, dramatically improving diagnostic capabilities for complex distributed issues while avoiding unnecessary data collection across the broader environment.

### Common Example of the Problem
Digital Banking Platform at a major financial institution consisted of over 40 microservices handling everything from authentication to transaction processing to notification delivery. Each service team implemented their own observability solutions, creating siloed visibility with no coordination between components.

During a recent incident, customers reported failed transfers in the mobile app. Initial alerts showed high error rates in the funds transfer service, prompting that team to increase their telemetry collection. However, despite extensive data gathering from this service, they couldn't identify the root cause. After nearly 35 minutes of investigation involving multiple teams, they discovered the actual issue originated in the account validation service, which was experiencing intermittent database timeouts. These timeouts caused ripple effects that only manifested as errors in the downstream funds transfer service.

The fragmented observability approach meant that while one team was collecting excessive data from the symptom-exhibiting service, they had minimal visibility into the actual problem source. This siloed approach extended mean time to resolution while simultaneously increasing overall observability costs as multiple teams reactively enabled verbose logging in their respective services.

### SRE Best Practice: Evidence-Based Investigation
Implementing effective cross-service propagation requires sophisticated systems that understand service relationships and transaction flows:

1. **Service Topology Mapping**: Develop comprehensive understanding of service dependencies:
   - Create automated service discovery that identifies dependencies between components
   - Build directed graph representations of service relationships
   - Identify critical paths in transaction flows across multiple services
   - Map both synchronous (API) and asynchronous (queue) dependencies
   - Understand data flow patterns between services

2. **Transaction Context Propagation**: Implement mechanisms to maintain transaction identity across services:
   - Deploy distributed tracing with consistent correlation identifiers
   - Implement header propagation standards across all services
   - Ensure context preservation through both synchronous and asynchronous boundaries
   - Maintain business context (transaction type, amount, etc.) alongside technical identifiers
   - Create probabilistic tracking for high-volume systems where complete tracing is impractical

3. **Coordinated Sampling Decisions**: Develop mechanisms to synchronize observability across services:
   - Implement centralized sampling coordinators that manage cross-service decisions
   - Create "sampling intent" propagation through transaction contexts
   - Develop inheritance mechanisms where downstream services respect upstream sampling decisions
   - Build bidirectional propagation that can increase observability both upstream and downstream
   - Implement rate limiting to prevent cascade effects from over-activating collection

4. **Intelligent Boundary Definition**: Create systems that properly scope the observability bubble:
   - Develop algorithms to determine appropriate propagation distance (how many services away)
   - Implement attenuation mechanisms that reduce sampling rates at increasing distance
   - Create service-type awareness that adjusts propagation based on component criticality
   - Build temporal boundaries that define how long enhanced collection should persist
   - Implement circuit breakers that prevent excessive propagation during large-scale issues

The most sophisticated implementations incorporate causal analysis that distinguishes between correlation and causation in service interactions. Rather than simply propagating to all connected services, these systems identify the most likely causal paths based on timing patterns, error types, and historical behavior, creating more targeted and efficient observability bubbles.

### Banking Impact
The business impact of coordinated cross-service observability extends far beyond technical efficiency:

1. **Accelerated Root Cause Analysis**: By automatically creating comprehensive visibility across service boundaries, organizations dramatically improve diagnosis speed. A payment processing platform reduced their mean time to identification by 67% after implementing cross-service propagation, directly reducing the business impact window during incidents.

2. **Reduced False Starts**: Without coordinated observability, teams often investigate symptoms rather than causes. One financial institution documented a 78% reduction in misdirected investigation efforts after implementing cross-service propagation, improving both resolution time and team efficiency.

3. **Transaction-Centric Insights**: For financial systems, individual transactions represent the true business value unit. Cross-service propagation creates transaction-centric rather than service-centric visibility. A wealth management platform leveraging this approach improved their ability to track individual high-value customer journeys across systems, increasing successful resolution of VIP client issues by 93%.

4. **Cost Optimization**: Despite increasing visibility, coordinated propagation often reduces overall observability costs by eliminating redundant collection. One bank reported a 41% reduction in total observability costs after implementing cross-service propagation, as targeted high-fidelity collection replaced broad-based instrumentation increases during incidents.

Beyond these immediate benefits, cross-service propagation fundamentally changes organizational dynamics during incidents. Rather than siloed teams defending their services, the comprehensive visibility creates shared understanding of distributed issues, fostering collaborative resolution rather than boundary disputes about where problems originated.

### Implementation Guidance
To implement effective cross-service propagation in banking environments, follow these five actionable steps:

1. **Implement Service Topology Discovery**:
   - Deploy service mesh or API gateway solutions that can track service relationships
   - Implement automated dependency detection through traffic analysis
   - Create visualization tools showing service relationships and transaction flows
   - Establish regular updates to topology maps as architecture evolves
   - Develop criticality classifications for different service relationships

2. **Establish Context Propagation Standards**:
   - Implement consistent distributed tracing across all services
   - Create standardized header propagation for maintaining transaction context
   - Develop correlation ID standards that persist across service boundaries
   - Implement context carriers for asynchronous communication (queues, events)
   - Create sampling decision propagation alongside business context

3. **Develop Coordinated Collection Controls**:
   - Implement centralized sampling coordination services
   - Create APIs allowing services to report anomalies and trigger propagation
   - Develop service-to-service communication protocols for observability coordination
   - Build intelligent propagation algorithms that determine appropriate boundaries
   - Implement fallback mechanisms when coordination services are unavailable

4. **Create Observability Bubble Management**:
   - Develop time-based expiration for enhanced collection states
   - Implement attenuation controls that reduce sampling rates at increasing distance
   - Create circuit breakers preventing excessive propagation during large-scale issues
   - Build authorization mechanisms ensuring only legitimate services can trigger propagation
   - Develop budget awareness that constrains propagation based on cost impact

5. **Establish Operational Framework**:
   - Create dashboards showing active observability bubbles across the environment
   - Implement notification systems alerting teams when their services enter enhanced collection
   - Develop log correlation tools that can aggregate data across the propagation boundary
   - Build post-incident analysis capabilities to evaluate propagation effectiveness
   - Create governance determining which services can initiate propagation under what conditions
