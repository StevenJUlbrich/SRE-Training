You've outlined the process very accurately! Let me confirm and slightly refine your understanding of the methodology we used for creating the SRE training material:

## SRE Training Material Development Process

1. **Define the SRE Topic**
   - Select a specific SRE domain (metrics, incident response, chaos engineering, etc.)
   - Determine the scope and boundaries of the content
   - Identify core principles and concepts that must be covered

2. **Define the Application Domain**
   - Select industry context (banking, healthcare, retail, etc.)
   - Identify domain-specific challenges and requirements
   - Consider regulatory and compliance factors unique to the domain

3. **Generate a High-Level Outline**
   - Create a broad overview of main topics to cover
   - Establish logical progression of concepts
   - Identify potential chapters and major sections

4. **Audience Analysis and Refinement**
   - Define specific knowledge gaps for production support to SRE transition
   - Identify existing skills that can be leveraged
   - Determine necessary mindset shifts (reactive to proactive)
   - Adjust terminology and examples to match audience experience level

5. **Domain-Specific Adaptation**
   - Tailor examples to reflect real industry scenarios
   - Connect SRE concepts to business metrics in the specific domain
   - Incorporate industry-specific technology stacks and tools

6. **Focus Distribution (85/15 Rule)**
   - Ensure 80-85% of content focuses on core SRE topic
   - Allocate 15-20% to supporting context, narratives, and domain-specific applications
   - Balance technical depth with practical application

7. **Learning Progression Organization**
   - Sequence content from fundamental to advanced concepts
   - Group related topics into logical chapters
   - Create a learning journey that builds progressive competence
   - Integrate key concepts with their technical implementation

8. **Pre-Scaffold Development**
   - Create structured chapter panels with scene descriptions
   - Develop teaching narratives for each concept
   - Ensure each panel addresses a specific learning objective
   - Verify logical flow within and between chapters

9. **Complete Scaffold Generation**
   - Expand pre-scaffold with full content structure
   - Ensure comprehensive coverage of all identified topics
   - Maintain consistent format and depth across chapters
   - Validate alignment with learning objectives

10. **Chapter Template Finalization**
    - Define standardized components for each chapter
    - Create consistent section structure for reader familiarity
    - Establish formatting and visual presentation standards
    - Ensure each component serves a specific learning purpose

11. **Chapter Scaffold Application**
    - Apply template to each chapter's content
    - Ensure all required sections are populated
    - Maintain consistent narrative tone and technical depth
    - Verify domain-specific examples are integrated appropriately

12. **Chapter Content Generation**
    - Develop full content for each chapter section
    - Create realistic scenarios and examples
    - Ensure proper technical accuracy and depth
    - Maintain connection between concepts and practical application

13. **Review, Validation, and Revision**
    - Evaluate content against learning objectives
    - Verify technical accuracy and best practices
    - Ensure appropriate complexity for target audience
    - Review domain-specific examples for realism and relevance

14. **Iterative Chapter Development**
    - Apply learnings from previous chapters to improve process
    - Maintain consistent terminology and frameworks
    - Ensure cohesive narrative across full training material
    - Verify progressive skill development throughout content

This methodology creates a comprehensive, structured approach to developing SRE training material that effectively bridges the gap between production support and Site Reliability Engineering roles. The process ensures content is technically accurate, practically relevant, and appropriately tailored to both the audience's needs and the specific domain application.
