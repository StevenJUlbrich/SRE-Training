I'll help you develop SRE training materials on 'Cost-Aware Observability' for banking professionals transitioning from production support roles, following the framework from the documents. Let's start by clearly defining the scope, core principles, and banking context for this topic.

# 1. Scope and Boundaries of 'Cost-Aware Observability'

Cost-Aware Observability refers to the strategic implementation and management of observability practices (metrics, logs, traces) while maintaining conscious control over associated costs. This approach balances the need for comprehensive system visibility with financial efficiency.

## Scope includes:
- The relationship between observability data volume and infrastructure costs
- Strategies for optimizing observability tool selection and implementation
- Methods for determining appropriate sampling rates and retention policies
- Techniques for prioritizing high-value observability signals
- Approaches for measuring and justifying observability ROI
- Governance frameworks for observability spending

## Scope excludes:
- Detailed implementation of specific observability tools or platforms
- General monitoring concepts without cost considerations
- Non-observability SRE practices (though we'll reference connections)
- General cloud cost optimization outside observability contexts

# 2. Core Principles and Concepts to Cover

## Foundational Concepts:
- The three pillars of observability (metrics, logs, traces) and their cost profiles
- Cardinality: definition, benefits, and cost implications
- The cost curve of observability: diminishing returns and optimization points
- Observability as an investment rather than pure overhead expense

## Intermediate Concepts:
- Strategic sampling: when and how to reduce data without losing insights
- Retention policies: balancing compliance needs with storage costs
- Tiered observability: applying different strategies based on service criticality
- Instrumentation optimization: capturing high-value signals while controlling volume
- Cost attribution models for observability across teams and services

## Advanced Concepts:
- Automated governance for observability spending
- Machine learning for intelligent data sampling and anomaly detection
- Right-sizing observability based on service SLOs and error budgets
- Cost-benefit analysis frameworks for observability investments
- Observability data lifecycle management

# 3. Banking/Financial Services Context

## Industry-Specific Application:
- Transaction monitoring systems with cost-effective observability
- Payment processing platforms and their observability requirements
- Trading systems with high-frequency, high-volume data challenges
- Regulatory compliance observability requirements (audit trails, evidence preservation)
- Customer-facing banking applications and their critical user journeys

## Banking-Specific Challenges:
- Financial transaction tracing across complex system boundaries
- Balancing real-time fraud detection needs with observability costs
- Long-term retention requirements for regulatory compliance
- Multi-geography deployment monitoring with different regulatory regimes
- Legacy banking system integration with modern observability practices

## Business Impact Factors:
- Direct infrastructure costs from observability data storage and processing
- Operational cost savings from improved incident detection and resolution
- Revenue protection through proactive issue identification
- Compliance penalties avoided through proper audit capabilities
- Customer trust and reputation preservation

This defined scope gives us a solid foundation to build out our training materials. We've established clear boundaries for what we'll cover, identified the essential concepts across skill levels, and contextualized everything within the banking industry's specific challenges and needs.

Would you like me to continue with the next steps in our process? I can help develop the high-level outline for the chapters and begin structuring the content progression for the Cost-Aware Observability training material.
