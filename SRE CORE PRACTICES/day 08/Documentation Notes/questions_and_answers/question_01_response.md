I've reviewed all the documents you've provided, and I have a clear understanding of the framework you're using to create SRE training materials. Let me summarize my understanding of your approach:

You're creating a hybrid graphic novel-style curriculum focused on SRE metrics for banking professionals who are transitioning from production support roles. The content follows a structured methodology with consistent templates and a 14-step development process.

## Key Elements of Your Framework

1. **Structured Chapter Format**
   - Each chapter contains multiple panels
   - Panels follow a consistent structure with scene descriptions, teaching narratives, and practical applications
   - Full panels include problem examples, SRE best practices, banking impact, and implementation guidance
   - The pre-scaffold version focuses on core teaching narratives

2. **Development Methodology**
   - 14-step process from topic definition to iterative development
   - Balance of 85% SRE content with 15% supporting context and narratives
   - Progressive learning journey from fundamentals to advanced concepts
   - Domain-specific adaptation for banking industry

3. **Content Focus**
   - Transforming traditional monitoring mindsets into SRE observability approaches
   - Character-driven scenarios that make technical concepts relatable
   - Visual reinforcement through scene descriptions
   - Banking-specific examples and real-world applications

4. **Educational Approach**
   - Narrative-driven learning that engages readers
   - Practical examples that connect theory to application
   - Clear progression through foundation, intermediate, and advanced tiers
   - Focus on mindset shifts needed for SRE roles

The example provided about "The Green Wall Fallacy" demonstrates how this approach works in practice: starting with a relatable scenario, explaining the core concept, showing its application in banking, and providing practical implementation steps.

Is this understanding aligned with your vision for the SRE training materials? Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of the framework?
