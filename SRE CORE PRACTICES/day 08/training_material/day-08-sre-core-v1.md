# 🧱 **Day 8: Observability Cost & Data Volume Management**

**Character:** Asha – Nairobi  
**Style:** Curious, disciplined, ruthless about waste  
**Vibe:** “Observability is a strategy, not a hoarder’s paradise.”

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

### 🔍 Beginner
- Identify the main cost drivers in observability pipelines  
- Understand the impact of signal frequency and cardinality

### 🧩 Intermediate
- Implement log sampling, trace filtering, and metric retention tuning  
- Design dashboards to balance signal fidelity with cost

### 💡 SRE-Level
- Architect tiered observability strategies (hot/warm/cold pipelines)  
- Implement telemetry cost governance across teams  
- Align retention with business needs and SLO impact

## 💥 Incident Hook: “The Log That Broke the Budget”

> “We onboarded a new service.  
> Logging at `DEBUG` for every auth check.  
> 500 RPS × 300B per line × 30 days = 💸💥  
> The storage bill hit $18k.  
> Worse? None of the logs were useful in triage.  
> We learned: **Observability ≠ everything, everywhere, all the time.**”

## 🧠 Core Concepts

### 🔹 What Costs You Money?

    C --> D[Dashboarding & Querying]
    D --> E[Retention Policies]
```

> Most costs come from:  
> - **Log volume**  
> - **Trace frequency**  
> - **Metric cardinality**  
> - **Storage duration**

### 🔹 Volume Management Strategies

| Signal     | Strategy                       | Example                          |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Logs       | Structured logging + sampling  | Only keep 10% of info/debug      |
| Traces     | Tail sampling, latency filters | Only keep slow requests          |
| Metrics    | Label control, recording rules | No `user_id` in labels           |
| Dashboards | Panel deduplication            | Avoid 100 PromQL queries at once |

---

### 🔹 Tiered Storage Model

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Live Metrics] --> B[Hot (1-7 days)]
    B --> C[Warm (7-30 days)]
    C --> D[Cold Archive (30-180 days)]
```

> “Hot” = fast access  
> “Warm” = infrequent access  
> “Cold” = compliance, not debugging

---

### 🔹 Cost-Aware Dashboarding

- ✅ Avoid: dozens of overlapping panels  
- ✅ Use: templated dashboards per service  
- ✅ Aggregate at the right level (e.g., `service=checkout`, not `pod_name=xyz123`)

🧠 Felix might love precision. Asha loves efficiency.

## 🧪 Simulation Exercise

You are given:

- A sample Fluentbit config logging `INFO`, `DEBUG`, and `WARN` for every endpoint  
- A cost chart:  
  - `INFO`: 5GB/day  
  - `DEBUG`: 22GB/day  
  - `WARN`: 1GB/day  
- Trace storage: 10 spans/request × 20k RPS = 17TB/month

📌 **Task:**
- What log level should be sampled?  
- What trace filter would reduce volume without losing signal?  
- How would you tune this system for cost awareness without sacrificing root cause discovery?

## 🛠 Tool Concepts (Descriptive Only)

### Log Sampling Example (Fluentbit)

```ini
[Filter]
  Name     grep
  Match    *
  Exclude  level debug
```

### Trace Sampling Strategy

```yaml
tail_sampling:
  policies:
    - name: "slow_requests"
      latency_threshold_ms: 500
```

### Metric Control: Avoid Exploding Labels

```promql
rate(api_requests_total{user_id=~".+"}[5m])  # NO
rate(api_requests_total{service="checkout"}[5m])  # YES
```

## 🕳️ Common Pitfalls

- Keeping debug logs in prod  
- Tracing 100% of all requests across all services  
- Never rotating logs or snapshots  
- Hoarding metrics with no consumers  
- Over-paneling: 47 dashboards, 2 people who use them

## 📜 Asha’s Commandments

1. “More data is not more observability.”  
2. “If no one reads it, don’t log it.”  
3. “You don’t need 1,000 dashboards. You need *one that tells the truth.*”

## 🤝 Handoff to Tomorrow

> “You’ve cleaned the signals. Tomorrow, Hector Alavaz comes back with the final lesson:  
> Culture. Toil. Readiness. And the long-term view of building reliability like it’s a product.”
