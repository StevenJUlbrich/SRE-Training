### Single-Panel Comic Prompt — “Burn Rate vs. Trust Balance”

Scene  
- Interior conference room, lights dimmed. Seating and walls fade into deep Charcoal Black (#1C1C1E); the only strong illumination comes from a **wall-scale line chart** filling the background:  
  • **Service A** — gentle Teal slope (#1ABC9C) trending downward at a calm angle.  
  • **Service B** — cliff-steep **Rust-Red** drop (#8B2E2E) plunging toward zero.  
  • **Deep-Amber** timestamp ticks (#C97E38) highlight key points along the x-axis, underscoring urgency.  
- **Hector** stands foreground-left, back-lit so his silhouette and red RHEL cap cut sharply against the graph; one hand lifts a black ceramic coffee mug toward the falling red line.  
- **Clara** sits front-right, a tablet in her hands mirroring the burn-rate chart in miniature.  
- **Juana** and **Daniel** occupy mid-ground seats, faces lit by the graph’s glow, eyes tracking the Rust-Red slope.

Characters (all physically present)  
1. **Hector Alvarez** — 49, medium build, salt-and-pepper beard, **red RHEL baseball cap (mandatory)**, dark henley, stainless-steel watch, black coffee mug raised in emphasis.  
2. **Clara** — early-30s Mexican engineer, low ponytail, slim ops jacket, tablet angled toward viewer; brows knit in concern.  
3. **Juana** — 34, 5'7", cropped hair, calm but focused, utility vest; arms folded, watching graph.  
4. **Daniel** — 31, light-brown skin with freckles, short curly hair, circuit-board tattoo visible on forearm; leans forward, elbows on table.

Dialogue (off-white #EDEDED speech bubbles; tails point to speakers)  
- **Hector:** “CPU didn’t move, but your trust balance is draining. That slope is your mortgage rate on failure.”  
- **Clara:** “So the alert fires earlier for Service B?”

Narration  
- Rust-Red ticker banner embedded at the lower edge of the big chart (not floating):  
  *“Burn-rate visual reveals how fast reliability credit evaporates.”*

Visual Style  
- Modern graphic-novel realism; clean, medium-weight line art; semi-realistic proportions.  
- Eye detail: full irises with reflections (no solid dots).  
- Lighting tri-tone: teal glow from Service A curve, intense rust-red wash from Service B cliff, deep-amber tick highlights.  
- Background kept minimal; focus on chart, characters, and text.

Color Palette  
- **Primary:** Charcoal Black #1C1C1E, Rust Red #8B2E2E, Slate Gray #3E4A59  
- **Supporting:** Ash Gray #B0B4B9, Muted Olive #586E4B, Off-White #EDEDED  
- **Highlights:** Deep Amber #C97E38, Teal #1ABC9C, System Blue #3478F6  

Constraints  
- Exactly four characters (Hector, Clara, Juana, Daniel) in view; no extras.  
- All speech bubbles clear of panel edges; text fully legible at final resolution.  
- Narration banner is part of the chart UI, not a floating textbox.  
- No motion blur, no watermarks, single widescreen panel.
