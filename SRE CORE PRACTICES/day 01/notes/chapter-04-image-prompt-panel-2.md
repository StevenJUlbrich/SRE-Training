### Single-Panel Comic Prompt — “Early-Morning NOC, Mexico City”

Scene
- Mexico-City network-operations center, dawn. Slate-gray dashboards (#3E4A59) tower above rows of dim monitors.  
- A tall window at frame-left catches the first sun; thin sunrise streaks of Muted Olive (#586E4B) rake across the room.  
- On the main wall: a **Rust-Red (#8B2E2E) bar chart** of alert counts dwarfs a flat green incident line.  
- Clara stands nearest the chart, circling the tallest spike with a stylus.  
- Daniel rubs gritty eyes beneath fluorescent glare; Juana scrolls a tablet; Hector hovers, coffee in hand, red RHEL cap tilted.  
- Ambient technology hum, cool monitor glow, and quiet tension dominate the atmosphere.

Characters  
1. **Clara** — early-30s Mexican engineer, medium complexion, shoulder-length dark hair pulled into a low ponytail. Slim build, smart-casual ops jacket; tablet stylus in hand.  
2. **Juana** — 34, 5’7″, cropped hair, calm stance, utility vest with tablet tucked under arm.  
3. **Daniel** — 31, light-brown skin with freckles, short curly hair, runner’s build. Circuit-board tattoo on forearm; hoodie sleeves pushed up.  
4. **Hector Alvarez** — 49, medium build, angular face, salt-and-pepper beard. Wears his **red RHEL baseball cap** (mandatory), dark henley shirt, stainless-steel watch, ceramic black mug.

Dialogue (speech bubbles, off-white #EDEDED, tails pointing to speakers)  
- **Clara:** “Fifty-three alerts from one rule?”  
- **Juana:** “Check the comment timestamp. Fourteen years ago.”  
- **Daniel:** “Better safe than sorry?”  
- **Hector:** “Geneos rules don’t fix modern risk. They just remind you how old your runbooks are.”

Narration  
- Rust-red ticker banner integrated at top-left of the largest dashboard:  
  *“Alert fatigue turns critical signals into background noise.”*

Visual Style  
- Modern graphic-novel realism, clean medium-weight lines, semi-realistic proportions.  
- Eyes fully rendered with irises and reflections (no solid dots).  
- Low-key lighting: soft dawn olive highlights + cool slate monitor tones + subtle rust-red accent from the bar chart.  
- Minimal background clutter; focus on dashboards, characters, and text.
