### Single-Panel Comic Prompt — “Static Thresholds at 02 : 47 AM”

Scene
- Interior, Nairobi studio flat, 02 : 47 AM. Only one person (Daniel) is physically present.
- Main light sources:
  1. **Rust-red (#8B2E2E) PagerDuty banner** on Daniel’s phone, casting a crimson rim-light on a charcoal-black wall (#1C1C1E) and Daniel’s face.  
  2. **System-blue (#3478F6) monitor glow** from an open laptop showing a CPU chart stalled at **87 %**.  
- A worn wooden table holds the phone, laptop, and a steaming mug; faint outlines of a single-room kitchenette lurk in darkness behind.

Characters
1. **Daniel** – 31 y/o Kenyan, light-brown skin with freckles, short curly hair, lanky runner’s build. Pajama T-shirt, earbuds half-dangling. Circuit-board tattoo visible on left forearm.  
   - Expression: groggy focus, eyes fully illustrated with iris reflections.  
   - Speech bubble (off-white #EDEDED, tail to Daniel):  
     **Daniel:** “Legacy spreadsheet said CPU costs money.  So we page.”  
2. **Slack Overlay** – Translucent holographic phone UI floating above the desk (NOT floating in mid-air; anchored to phone screen).  
   - **Narration ticker** across the top edge of the overlay, rust-red banner with white text:  
     *“Static thresholds jolt Daniel awake while customers sleep fine.”*  
   - **Chat bubble 1** – avatar of Juana (female, cropped-hair) inside circle; off-white rounded rectangle:  
     **Juana:** “Let me guess — Geneos rule from 2009?”  
   - **Chat bubble 2** – same avatar:  
     **Juana (again):** “Users cost more.  Where’s *their* metric in that alert?”  
   - **Chat bubble 3** – avatar of Hector (male, red RHEL baseball cap, salt-and-pepper beard):  
     **Hector:** “Daniel, stop admiring server sweat.  If customers aren’t screaming, go back to bed.”

Visual Style
- Modern graphic-novel realism, clean medium-weight line art, semi-realistic proportions.
- “Quiet vigilance” mood: sparse background detail; focus on faces, screens, and text.
- Eyes must have irises and light reflections (no solid black dots).
- No flashy gimmicks, no motion blur, no watermarks.

Color Palette
- **Primary:** Charcoal Black #1C1C1E, Rust Red #8B2E2E, Slate Gray #3E4A59  
- **Supporting:** Ash Gray #B0B4B9, Muted Olive #586E4B, Off-White #EDEDED  
- **Highlights:** Deep Amber #C97E38, System Blue #3478F6  

Constraints
- Juana and Hector appear **only** inside the Slack overlay; they are **not** rendered full-body in the room.
- All on-screen text must be fully legible at final resolution; speech bubbles and overlay elements must avoid touching panel edges.
- Narration ticker is part of the phone UI, not a free-floating caption box.
- Single widescreen panel, dark background kept clutter-free to emphasize UI elements and dialogue.
