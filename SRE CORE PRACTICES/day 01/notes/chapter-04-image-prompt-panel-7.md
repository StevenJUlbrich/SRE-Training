### Single-Panel Comic Prompt — “Signing the Alert Litmus”

Scene  
- Bright off-white conference area; morning sunlight diffuses through floor-to-ceiling glass on the left.  
- Center-back wall features a large, bold banner in Slate Gray (#3E4A59) text reading **“Quality Beats Quantity.”**  
- Slate-gray conference table (#3E4A59) dominates the foreground. Upon it lies a parchment-style document titled **“Alert Litmus”** in elegant serif. Team members are gathered around, fountain pens poised to sign.  
- Two deep-olive plants (#586E4B) at frame edges soften the modern space.  
- **Hector’s** red RHEL baseball cap (#8B2E2E) and polished silver watch catch the morning light in the near foreground, drawing the viewer’s eye.

Characters (all physically present)  
1. **Hector Alvarez** — 49, salt-and-pepper beard, **red RHEL cap (mandatory)**, dark henley, stainless-steel watch glinting. Standing foreground-right, confident stance.  
2. **Aisha** — 30, warm brown complexion, micro-braids in bun, charcoal tech hoodie. Holds a pen over the parchment, gentle smile.  
3. **Daniel** — 31, light-brown skin with freckles, short curly hair, circuit-board tattoo visible at wrist; hoodie sleeves rolled.  
4. **Clara** — early-30s, low ponytail, slim ops jacket; leaning forward to sign.  
5. **Juana** — 34, cropped hair, utility vest; tablet tucked under arm, reading the document.

Dialogue (off-white #EDEDED speech bubbles, tails to speakers)  
- **Hector:** “No alert ships until it answers the litmus test.”  
- **Aisha:** “Here’s to quieter pagers and happier customers.”

Narration  
- Rust-red banner (#8B2E2E) integrated as a slim footer beneath the parchment (UI style, not floating):  
  *“Chapter closes with team committing to outcome-focused alerting.”*

Visual Style  
- Modern graphic-novel realism; clean, medium-weight line art; semi-realistic proportions.  
- Warm morning key light; soft off-white bounce fills shadows.  
- Eyes fully illustrated with irises and reflections (no solid dots).  
- Banner text and parchment headline rendered clearly and legibly.
