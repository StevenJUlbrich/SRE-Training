### Single-Panel Comic Prompt — “Monitor the Scream, Not the Sweat”

Scene  
- **Split-screen projection wall** dominates the background, bisecting the frame horizontally:  
  1. **Top half** — benign CPU-utilization graph in Muted Olive (#586E4B): a low, rounded spike labelled “CPU 75 % – within limits.”  
  2. **Bottom half** — blazing **Rust-Red (#8B2E2E) error-rate line** jagging upward; a horizontal ticker beneath scrolls angry customer-complaint snippets (legible UI text).  
- Soft, slate-gray dashboard glow (#3E4A59) back-lights the characters and casts subtle reflections on the floor.  
- Camera at mid-chest height, slight three-quarter angle so the split-screen fills the upper background and the team stands mid-frame.

Characters (all physically present)  
1. **Aisha** — 30-year-old Kenyan SRE, warm brown complexion; neat micro-braids pulled into a loose bun. Wearing a fitted charcoal tech-hoodie, sleeves rolled just below the elbow.  
   - Stands center-frame, body angled toward the projection; eyes fixed on the red error line, face lit by dashboard glow.  
2. **Clara** — early-30s Mexican engineer, shoulder-length dark hair in low ponytail, slate ops jacket, tablet tucked under arm. Looks from Aisha to the projection, brows raised.  
3. **Hector Alvarez** — 49, medium build, salt-and-pepper beard, **red RHEL baseball cap (mandatory)**, dark henley shirt, stainless-steel watch, black ceramic mug. Leans into the contrasting panels like a coach dissecting game film; one hand points at the red line.

Dialogue (off-white #EDEDED speech bubbles, tails to speakers)  
- **Aisha:** “We alerted on the lungs wheezing, not the heart stopping.”  
- **Clara:** “So we page on pain, not panting?”  
- **Hector:** “Correct. Monitor the scream, not the sweat.”

Narration  
- Rust-red ticker banner integrated at top-left of the projection (not floating):  
  *“Team learns to pivot from machine signals to customer symptoms.”*

Visual Style  
- Modern graphic-novel realism; clean medium-weight line art; semi-realistic proportions.  
- Fully rendered eyes with irises and reflections (never solid dots).  
- Lighting tri-tone: olive glow from CPU graph above, rust-red wash from error graph below, neutral slate ambient fill.  
- Minimal background clutter to keep focus on split-screen and characters.

Color Palette  
- **Primary:** Charcoal Black #1C1C1E, Rust Red #8B2E2E, Slate Gray #3E4A59  
- **Supporting:** Ash Gray #B0B4B9, Muted Olive #586E4B, Off-White #EDEDED  
- **Highlights:** Deep Amber #C97E38, System Blue #3478F6  

Constraints  
- Exactly three characters (Aisha, Clara, Hector) visible; no other figures.  
- Speech bubbles clear of panel edges; all text fully legible at final resolution.  
- Narration banner is part of the projection UI, not a free-floating textbox.  
- No motion blur, no watermarks, single widescreen panel.
