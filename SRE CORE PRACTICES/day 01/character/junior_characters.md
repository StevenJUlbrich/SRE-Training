## 🗂️ Usage Guidance
- These characters can appear in voice widgets (e.g. `:::learner perspective`), dialogue, or reflection prompts.
- Consider mapping each learner to key SRE topics:
  - **Wanjiru** → Alert fatigue, deployment
  - **Manu** → Monitoring vs. observability
  - **Aisha** → SLAs vs. SLOs
  - **Danny** → Automation, scripting
  - **Njeri** → Networking, resilience
  - **Clara** → Failure testing, dashboards
  - **Omar** → Incident comms, cultural handoff
  - **Sofia** → Metrics, tracing

This document ensures tonal and character consistency across modules and chapters.
