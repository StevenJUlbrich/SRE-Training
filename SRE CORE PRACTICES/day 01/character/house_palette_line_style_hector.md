# Hector Alvarez: Palette, Line Style & Visual Direction

## Color Palette

1. **Primary Colors**:
   - **Charcoal Black** (#1C1C1E): For interfaces, dashboards, and general framing — serious and sleek
   - **Rust Red** (#8B2E2E): Alert tones, stress moments, or visual tension
   - **Slate Gray** (#3E4A59): Used for primary UI contrast and background depth

2. **Supporting Colors**:
   - **Ash Gray** (#B0B4B9): Secondary elements, annotations, subdued components
   - **Muted Olive** (#586E4B): For subdued status indications and system stability highlights
   - **Off-White** (#EDEDED): For clean backgrounds or text overlays without blinding contrast

3. **Highlight Colors**:
   - **Deep Amber** (#C97E38): Used sparingly for highlighting key log entries or attention lines
   - **System Blue** (#3478F6): For selected metrics, buttons, or trace highlights — cool and technical

## Line Style & Art Direction

### Line Work:
- **Style**: Clean, precise lines with slight grit — enough character to show humanity without clutter
- **Weight**: Thin to medium-weight outlines, favoring precision and legibility over stylization
- **Expression**: Faces and body language convey confidence, fatigue, and control — not cheeriness or theatricality

### Technical Elements:
- High-contrast, dark-themed dashboards
- Minimal UI chrome — functional visuals like graphs, traces, histograms, and damage flow diagrams
- Clean typography for log entries and labels; monospace fonts used sparingly for code elements
- Diagrams appear hand-sketched but readable — organized, intentional, labeled

### Environment & Setting:
- Dimly lit but modern control rooms
- Large data displays on walls, clean desks with personal utility items (mugs, notebooks, tablets)
- Mexico City skyline subtly visible in background windows or environmental details
- Minimal personal décor: a photo, sticky note, or memento — but only one

### Character Design:
- Hector wears a red RHEL cap, dark henley or technical long sleeve shirt, durable jeans or pants, no loud colors
- Short gray beard, tired but alert eyes
- Hands show slight age and use — minimal jewelry, practical watch
- Stance and posture reflect a quiet intensity; gestures are minimal but meaningful
- Always portrayed with a mug, tablet, or notebook — he is never idle

## Layout Approach

- **Panel Structure**:
  - Use 1–3 panels per visual teaching sequence for clarity
  - Maintain simple, cinematic compositions with tight focus on interaction or data insight

- **Text Integration**:
  - Use sharp, rectangular speech bubbles with plain type
  - Inline logs or dashboard elements should be legible, labeled, and real

- **Visual Metaphors**:
  - Metrics = pulse; logs = timeline; traces = diagnosis map
  - Visuals should favor *diagnosis and clarity* over metaphorical abstraction
  - Banking metaphors that translate technical concepts into financial terms
  - Clear visual distinction between "theory" sections and "practical application" sections

This style emphasizes modern professionalism, technical authority, and visual clarity — Hector’s world doesn’t use flair to teach; it uses facts, and it’s built to survive the next failure.
