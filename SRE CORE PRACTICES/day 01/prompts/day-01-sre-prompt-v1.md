I'll create a more focused prompt for Day 1 of the SRE training curriculum that addresses the issues you've identified.

```
Create a revised Day 1 for the SRE Core Training Curriculum titled "Foundations of Observability" featuring Hector. Focus exclusively on building a conceptual foundation without implementation details.

1. Character Introduction (Brief, Narrator Voice)
   - Introduce Hector from Mexico City (experienced SRE)
   - One memorable quote that captures his philosophy on observability

2. The Incident Hook (Hector's Voice)
   - Tell a compelling story about system failure that appeared healthy on dashboards
   - Show how lack of proper observability extended the incident
   - End with a clear lesson about monitoring vs. observability

3. Learning Objectives (Narrator Voice)
   - üîç Beginner: Define the 3 Pillars of Observability; distinguish monitoring from observability
   - üß© Intermediate: Understand the "Observe, Test, Evaluate, Act" framework
   - üí° Advanced: Recognize different levels of observability maturity

4. The OTEA Framework (Narrator Voice with Hector examples)
   - Make this the CENTRAL organizing principle of Day 1
   - Explain each step with clear examples from Hector's incident
   - Show how each step connects to the pillars of observability
   - Include a Mermaid diagram showing the cycle

5. The Three Pillars (Narrator Voice)
   - Metrics: What they are and what questions they answer (not how to implement)
   - Logs: What they are and what questions they answer (not how to implement)
   - Traces: What they are and what questions they answer (not how to implement)
   - Include a simple Mermaid diagram showing their relationship

6. Golden Signals (Hector's Voice)
   - Explain what they are and why they matter
   - Show how they connect to user experience
   - Brief examples of how they manifest in real systems

7. Hands-On Exercise (Narrator Voice)
   - Provide mock data from three sources: metrics, logs, and traces
   - Present a scenario where these signals contradict each other
   - Task: Identify which signal is lying and why
   - Include a step-by-step thought process (not code solution)

8. Common Pitfalls (Hector's Voice)
   - 3 specific conceptual mistakes in observability thinking
   - How to recognize and avoid them

9. Hector's Commandments (Hector's Voice)
   - 3 memorable principles about observability mindset (not implementation)

10. Key Takeaways and Handoff (Narrator Voice)
    - Summary focusing on conceptual understanding
    - Clear bridge to Day 2, explaining how implementation will build on concepts

Important guidelines:
- NO code examples in the main content (can mention CLI tools conceptually)
- Focus on WHY before HOW
- Maintain narrative cohesion with consistent voice
- Use simple Mermaid diagrams to illustrate concepts only
- Keep examples tool-agnostic where possible
- Make OTEA the central framework that everything else connects to
- Aim for conceptual clarity that prepares learners for implementation in later days

For Mermaid diagrams:
- All sequenceDiagram blocks must include autonumber
- Use &commat; in place of @ in any email addresses
- Use <br> to replace \n
```

This prompt:

1. Centers the OTEA framework as the primary organizing principle
2. Eliminates code examples entirely from Day 1
3. Focuses on building conceptual understanding before implementation
4. Maintains narrative consistency with clear voice distinctions
5. Emphasizes the "why" of observability, not the "how"
6. Provides a clearer structure that builds knowledge progressively

The goal is a Day 1 that leaves learners with a solid conceptual foundation and eager to learn implementation details in subsequent days, rather than overwhelmed with technical specifics before they understand core concepts.
