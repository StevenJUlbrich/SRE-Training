## ✅ MASTER CHAPTER GENERATION PROMPT – CHAPTER 6

You are generating Chapter 6 of an illustrated, instructional novella about observability and SRE systems in banking. This chapter focuses on metric design, cardinality, naming, and diagnostic clarity.

### 📁 Required References

Use ONLY the following files:

* `authoring_contract_hector_v2.yaml` – structure, prose style, widgets, pacing【304†source】
* `chapter_6_outline.md` – primary concepts, panel beats, teaching sequences, artifact expectations【new】

### ❌ DO NOT:

* Add panels beyond the 9 defined in the outline
* Add quizzes, labs, or bonus scenes
* Include characters not in the provided cast
* Invent new metrics or tools not described in the outline

---

### 🧱 STRUCTURE:

Start with:

```markdown
# Chapter 6 – “Metrics Aren’t Just Numbers — They’re Clues”
```

Then follow the section structure from `authoring_contract_hector_v2.yaml`. Each panel must:

* Align to the beat-to-concept map in `chapter_6_outline.md`
* Include a 1–2 paragraph scene and dialogue (minimum)
* Integrate technical artifacts (CLI/code/logs/diagram) as defined
* Include one properly styled widget per teaching sequence (reflection, debug, try this, etc.)

Target **12,000–18,000 narrative words**, excluding CLI/code blocks.

---

### ✍️ STYLE & VOICE:

* Hector’s tone: strategic, dry, direct
* Let Sofia voice curiosity, Clara voice clarity, Wanjiru voice business impact
* Keep scenes realistic, observability-focused, and concept-driven
* Ensure diagrams and log excerpts reinforce each teaching beat

---

### 🧠 INTRODUCTION REQUIREMENTS

The Chapter Overview must:

* Be 5 paragraphs
* Introduce the idea that metrics, when misunderstood, create false confidence
* Explain what cardinality, naming, and diagnostic signal mean in a banking stack
* Describe a real consequence of telemetry overload or useless visualizations
* Preview how clarity comes from better metric structure—not more graphs

---

### 🧪 VALIDATION CHECKLIST (POST-GENERATION)

Ensure:

* Panel count = 9
* One widget per teaching sequence is embedded
* At least one diagram (Mermaid or image) supports metric hierarchy
* Chapter overview is 5 paragraphs, banking-relevant, teaching-focused
* Narrative length = 12,000–18,000 (excluding CLI/code)

---

### 🧪 BEGIN GENERATION:

Do not invent structure or characters. Generate using the teaching arc in the outline.
Start from:

```markdown
# Chapter 6 – “Metrics Aren’t Just Numbers — They’re Clues”
```

Continue through all 9 panels. End with a learner reflection and a Hector aphorism.
