# Chapter 6 – “Metrics Aren’t Just Numbers — They’re Clues”

## 🧠 Primary Concept

**Metrics are not status—they’re storytelling.** What you track is what you believe.

______________________________________________________________________

### 🧩 Key Terms Introduced

- Cardinality
- Metric taxonomy
- Signal vs noise
- Metric hierarchy (customer → service → system)
- Business-aligned metrics

______________________________________________________________________

### 📊 Teaching Objective

Learners should walk away understanding:

- Why metric design matters more than metric count
- How naming, ownership, and structure influence diagnostics
- How to tame cardinality and create interpretable dashboards

______________________________________________________________________

### 🧱 Banking Anchor

- Balance lookup service misdiagnosed by noisy CPU metrics
- Real issue: cache miss rate hidden by clutter
- Configuration change with no annotation causes observability gap

## 🧪 Teaching Sequences (Per Panel)

### Panel 1 – The Phantom Spike

- **Scene**: Sofia sees a scary CPU spike, but no actual outage
- **Teaching Moment**: Not all metrics are symptoms
- **Widget**: Reflection — “Which metrics frighten but don’t explain?”
- **Artifact**: Graph: CPU spike with no correlating user complaint

### Panel 2 – Cardinality Explosion

- **Scene**: Clara shows thousands of user-tagged metrics
- **Teaching Moment**: Too much variation = unstable signal
- **Widget**: Debug Pattern — Unbounded Metric Cardinality
- **Artifact**: Metric with exploding label set (`user_id`, `product_id`, etc.)

### Panel 3 – The Naming Nightmare

- **Scene**: Daniel shows a nonsense metric name
- **Teaching Moment**: Naming reflects intent—or the lack of it
- **Widget**: Try This — Audit your 5 worst metric names
- **Artifact**: `agg_metric_report_perf_multi_v2` = mystery metric

### Panel 4 – Metric Hygiene Time

- **Scene**: Hector whiteboards a metric stack: customer > SLI > infra
- **Teaching Moment**: Structure reveals diagnostic flow
- **Widget**: Diagram — Metric hierarchy (Mermaid chart)
- **Artifact**: Venn or stack showing metric grouping logic

### Panel 5 – Symptoms vs Signals

- **Scene**: Wanjiru shows cache miss rate; connects to real slowness
- **Teaching Moment**: Business failures don’t always ride on system spikes
- **Widget**: Reflection — “Which metric best reflects your user’s pain?”
- **Artifact**: Cache miss vs lookup latency correlation graph

### Panel 6 – Dashboard Cleanup Begins

- **Scene**: Team removes redundant panels, renames fields
- **Teaching Moment**: Simpler telemetry creates faster insight
- **Widget**: Try This — Rename one dashboard metric this week
- **Artifact**: Before/after of dashboard panel + annotated notes

### Panel 7 – Reality Revealed

- **Scene**: Clean dashboard tells causal story: config → cache → CPU
- **Teaching Moment**: Metric narrative > metric snapshot
- **Widget**: Diagram — Trace + metric path visual
- **Artifact**: Combined dashboard: cache miss, retry count, latency

### Panel 8 – Lesson Locked In

- **Scene**: Hector compares old and new dashboard state
- **Teaching Moment**: Your system is speaking—are you listening?
- **Widget**: Hector Quote — “Don’t measure more. Measure better.”
- **Artifact**: Final, cleaned dashboard layout

### Panel 9 – Epilogue Panel

- **Scene**: Sofia and Wanjiru reflect on noise vs clarity
- **Teaching Moment**: What changed wasn't the system—it was their view
- **Widget**: Reflection — “When did your metrics finally make sense?”
- **Artifact**: Screenshot of new dashboard w/ anomaly correctly surfaced

______________________________________________________________________

## 👤 Character Learning Beat

- **Sofia**: Detects misleading signal but seeks clarity
- **Clara**: Drives taxonomy and reduction
- **Daniel**: Highlights naming debt
- **Wanjiru**: Connects metric gaps to customer pain
- **Hector**: Reframes telemetry design as storytelling, not collection
