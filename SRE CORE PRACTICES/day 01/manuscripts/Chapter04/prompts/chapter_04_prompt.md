### ❌ DO NOT:

- Add panels beyond the 7 defined in the outline
- Add quizzes, labs, or bonus scenes
- Include characters not in the provided cast
- Break structure or pacing rules in the contract
- Invent new tools or frameworks

______________________________________________________________________

### 🧱 STRUCTURE:

Start with:

```markdown
# Chapter 4 – “You’re Not Alerting — You’re Alarming”
```

Then follow the section structure from `authoring_contract_hector_v2.yaml`. Each panel must:

- Align to the beat-to-concept map in `chapter_4_outline.md`
- Include a 1–2 paragraph scene and dialogue (minimum)
- Integrate technical artifacts (CLI/code/logs/diagram) as defined
- Include one properly styled widget per teaching sequence (reflection, debug, try this, etc.)

Target **12,000–18,000 narrative words**, excluding CLI/code blocks.

______________________________________________________________________

### ✍️ STYLE & VOICE:

- Use Hector’s sharp, practical tone from his persona file
- Let Daniel feel exhausted, Clara sound assertive, Juana stay cool-headed
- Keep scenes cinematic but always instructional
- Ensure visuals and prose reinforce the declared learning objective

______________________________________________________________________

### 🧠 INTRODUCTION REQUIREMENTS

The Chapter Overview section must:

- Be 5 paragraphs
- Explain why traditional alerts (CPU thresholds, static rules) fail in modern systems
- Define burn rate, SLO alerting, and error budget concepts
- Give a real banking scenario where noise prevented action
- Preview the shift to fewer, more meaningful alerts

______________________________________________________________________

### 🧪 VALIDATION CHECKLIST (POST-GENERATION)

Ensure:

- Panel count = 7
- One widget per teaching sequence is embedded
- All teaching sequences are complete: concept → scene → artifact → CTA
- Chapter overview meets paragraph and concept clarity requirements
- Narrative length = 12,000–18,000 (excluding code)

______________________________________________________________________

### 🧪 BEGIN GENERATION:

Do not invent structure or characters. Generate using the teaching arc in the outline.
Start from:

```markdown
# Chapter 4 – “You’re Not Alerting — You’re Alarming”
```

Continue through all 7 panels. End with a reflection, an assessment hook, and a Hector aphorism.
