## ✅ MASTER CHAPTER GENERATION PROMPT – CHAPTER 3

You are generating Chapter 3 of an illustrated, instructional novella about observability in banking systems. Your goal is to produce teaching-rich markdown content that blends narrative, CLI/code examples, widgets, and graphic panel descriptions.

### 📁 Required References
Use ONLY the following files:
- `authoring_contract_hector_v2.yaml` – structure, prose style, widgets, pacing【304†source】
- `chapter_3_outline.md` – primary concepts, panel beats, teaching sequences, artifact expectations【new】
- `hector_alvarez_persona.md` + `hector_alvaz_quotes_catch-phrases.md` – tone, delivery, emotional rhythm【309†source】【311†source】
- `junior_characters.md`, `sre_other_characters.md` – learner arc and cast constraints【307†source】【306†source】
- `house_palette_line_style_hector.md` – visual clarity and diagrammatic tone【308†source】

### ❌ DO NOT:
- Add panels beyond the 8 defined in the outline
- Add quizzes, labs, or bonus scenes
- Include characters not in the provided cast
- Break the structure or pacing rules in the contract
- Invent new tools or technologies

---

### 🧱 STRUCTURE:
Start with:
```markdown
# Chapter 3 – “Logs That Talk, Metrics That Matter”
```
Then follow the section structure from `authoring_contract_hector_v2.yaml`. Each panel must:
- Align to the beat-to-concept map in `chapter_3_outline.md`
- Include a 1–2 paragraph scene and dialogue (minimum)
- Integrate technical artifacts (CLI/code/logs/diagram) as defined
- Include one properly styled widget per teaching sequence (reflection, debug, try this, etc.)

Target **12,000–18,000 narrative words**, excluding CLI/code blocks.

---

### ✍️ STYLE & VOICE:
- Use Hector’s dry, practical tone from his persona file
- Keep panels cinematic but always instructional
- Ensure visuals and prose reinforce the declared learning objective

---

### 🧠 INTRODUCTION REQUIREMENTS
The Chapter Overview section must:
- Be **5 full paragraphs long**
- Include an anecdotal opening or example of "too much logging" in a banking or production context
- Clearly define "signal vs. noise" in both logs and metrics
- Set up the failure state of this chapter (why verbose telemetry caused diagnostic delay)
- Close with a preview of how structure and clarity will emerge by the end of the chapter

---

### 🧪 VALIDATION CHECKLIST (POST-GENERATION)
Ensure:
- Panel count = 8
- One widget per teaching sequence is embedded
- All teaching sequences are complete: concept → scene → CLI or diagram → widget or CTA
- Narrative length is between 12,000–18,000 words (excluding code blocks)
- Chapter overview is 5 paragraphs, meets clarity goals
- Characters remain in-voice and adhere to assigned learning arcs

---

### 🧪 BEGIN GENERATION:
Do not invent structure or characters. Generate using the teaching arc in the outline.
Start from:
```markdown
# Chapter 3 – “Logs That Talk, Metrics That Matter”
```
Continue through all 8 panels. End with a reflection, assessment hook, and Hector’s closing line.
