Lines scream past at 3 k/second—`DEBUG payments.*`—like Matrix glyphs. Disk‑IO and Kafka in‑topic gauges blink crimson at 95 MB/s and 14 k msg/s, spilling to a sidebar alert: *Indexer queue saturation 87 %*. Leonel, hoodie half‑zipped, proudly gestures at the torrent. Katherine shields her eyes from the flicker. A single red **ERROR**—`NullPointerException at DebitProcessor`—flashes then vanishes. Hector strides in holding a chipped mug, shadow stretching across the consoles. He kills the tail with **Ctrl‑C**, types a severity filter (`level>=WARN AND service=payments`) plus a `fields transactionId,amount` extractor. The screen collapses to three precise lines, each highlighted amber. The room’s neon reflection fades from frantic to focused.",
