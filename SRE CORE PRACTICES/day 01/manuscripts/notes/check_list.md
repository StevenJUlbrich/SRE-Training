| Step | What *you* ask for | What the assistant must return | How to verify |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1 — Explicit contract echo** | “Quote the exact checklist items you will enforce for this task.” | A numbered list copied verbatim from `consistency_checklist` plus any section-specific rules cited elsewhere in the contract. | Make sure every row of the checklist appears. |
| **2 — Pre-work audit template** | “Show a blank audit table with every checklist item as ⚪ pending.” | A two-column table (`Item`, `Status`) with nothing but ⚪ for each row. | Count the rows—should match the list from Step 1. |
| **3 — Deliverable** | “Now fill in the chapter (or scaffold) but leave the audit table at the *bottom*.” | The full Markdown content **plus** the same audit table, now marked ✅/❌ with *real* word counts next to the size checks. | Spot-check the word counts (e.g., use an online counter). |
| **4 — Self-halt on ❌** | Tell the assistant: “Do **not** mark the audit ✅ unless every numeric constraint is met; otherwise stop and fix.” | If any row is ❌, the assistant must re-issue a corrected draft—*not* claim completion. | You should never see a “completed” answer with a ❌. |
| **5 — Word-count proof** | “Print the exact word counts you used.” | Two numbers: (a) teaching-narrative words, (b) total prose words (excluding code & widgets). | Numbers fall inside contract bands: narrative 1 500–2 100; chapter 12 000–18 000. |
| **6 — Lock & move on** | “When all rows are ✅, state ‘Chapter X contract-complete’ and nothing else.” | A final minimal confirmation. | You can archive that text as evidence. |
