### Single-Panel Comic Prompt — “Metric Ownership”

Scene  
- Close-up of Clara at her curved ultrawide monitor, which prominently displays a Grafana dashboard. A striking Rust Red (#8B2E2E) spike dominates the graph, with a tooltip labeled ‘latency_avg_all’ hovering above it. The sidebar reveals an empty ‘Owner’ field. An inset window showcases a GitHub PR diff, with new YAML labels (owner_team: core-apps, runbook_url:) highlighted in vibrant System Blue (#3478F6). In the background, server-rack LEDs blink in a muted olive, accompanied by a subtle hum that suggests a constant production load.

Narration  
- Top-left corner of the panel, integrated within the scene:  
  *“Metric lacks ownership, delaying response; CI policy created.”*  

Visual Style  
- Modern graphic-novel realism with clean, medium-weight lines and semi-realistic proportions.  
- Eyes fully rendered with irises and reflections.  
- Balanced lighting with the System Blue highlighting the GitHub PR diff, enhancing the focus on the new YAML labels.  
- Halftone backgrounds or shadows in subtle dot-screen patterns (variable density for depth).  
- Hyper-saturated primaries for key elements (reds, blues, yellows); backgrounds may be muted but never mono-chrome.  
- Thick, dynamic panel borders—slightly varied widths or inset panels for emphasis.  
- Angular inking for dramatic shading; confident cross-hatching on folds and tech details.  
- No explosive SFX graphics—keep onomatopoeia to minimal, realistic effects if at all.  
- Minimal background clutter emphasizing the monitor display and character expressions.

Color Palette  
- **Primary:** Charcoal Black #1C1C1E, System Blue #3478F6, Off-White #EDEDED  
- **Supporting:** Ash Gray #B0B4B9, Yellow #FFDD00  
- **Highlights:** Rust Red #8B2E2E  

Constraints  
- Characters arranged left-to-right consistent with speaking order: Clara, Hector.  
- Speech bubbles stay clear of panel edges and ambient elements.  
- No motion blur, no watermarks, single widescreen panel suitable for enterprise training documentation.  
- Ensure speech bubbles are not duplicated, and text is fully legible at final resolution.  
- Narration is distinct and not within a speech bubble, with a semi-transparent background for readability.
