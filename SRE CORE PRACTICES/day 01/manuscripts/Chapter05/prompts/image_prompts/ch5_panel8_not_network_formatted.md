### Single-Panel Comic Prompt — “Network Clarity”

**Scene**  
- The panel features a large 4K monitor prominently displaying a Slack thread. Daniel's message, "MPLS spike?" is visible, with a spreadsheet checklist overlay showing green check-marks next to 'Packet Loss' and 'Interface Errors'. Njeri stands confidently with arms crossed, theatrically draping an Ethernet cable over one hand. The background is illuminated by an LED strip that fades from System Blue (#3478F6) to indicate a calm network status. Daniel is slightly slumped, holding a coffee-stained notebook, his eyes conveying an apologetic demeanor.

**Visual Style**  
- Modern graphic-novel realism with clean, medium-weight lines and semi-realistic proportions.  
- Eyes fully rendered with irises and reflections.  
- Balanced lighting with System Blue highlighting the calm network status, enhancing focus on the scene's clarity.  
- Halftone backgrounds or shadows in subtle dot-screen patterns (variable density for depth).  
- Hyper-saturated primaries for key elements (reds, blues, yellows); backgrounds may be muted but never mono-chrome.  
- Thick, dynamic panel borders—slightly varied widths or inset panels for emphasis.  
- Angular inking for dramatic shading; confident cross-hatching on folds and tech details.  
- No explosive SFX graphics—keep onomatopoeia to minimal, realistic effects if at all.  
- Minimal background clutter emphasizing the monitor display and character expressions.
