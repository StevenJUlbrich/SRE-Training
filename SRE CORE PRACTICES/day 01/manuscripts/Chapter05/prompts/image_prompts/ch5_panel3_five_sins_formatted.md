### Single-Panel Comic Prompt — “Five Observability Sins”

**Scene**  
- A mobile whiteboard stands prominently in front of a frosted-glass wall. Drawn in thick Rust Red marker are five distinct icons: a broken chain, a ringing bell, a corked bottle, a hollow green circle, and a tangled cable. Each icon is labeled in bold charcoal with Hector’s angular handwriting. Learner laptops are open on a slate-gray conference table, reflecting the red icons on their screens. Overhead pendant lamps cast soft pools of off-white (#EDEDED) light, illuminating dust motes and the anxious expressions of the characters.

- Modern graphic-novel realism with clean, medium-weight lines and semi-realistic proportions.  
- Eyes fully rendered with irises and reflections.  
- Balanced lighting with the Rust Red highlighting the icons, enhancing focus on the whiteboard.  
- Halftone backgrounds or shadows in subtle dot-screen patterns (variable density for depth).  
- Hyper-saturated primaries for key elements (reds, blues, yellows); backgrounds may be muted but never mono-chrome.  
- Thick, dynamic panel borders—slightly varied widths or inset panels for emphasis.  
- Angular inking for dramatic shading; confident cross-hatching on folds and tech details.  
- No explosive SFX graphics—keep onomatopoeia to minimal, realistic effects if at all.  
- Minimal background clutter emphasizing the whiteboard and character expressions.
