### Single-Panel Comic Prompt — “Geneos War-Room Reality Check”

#### Scene

- **Interior:** A dimly lit, windowless Geneos war-room. The room is initially illuminated by 24 wall-mounted dashboards displaying System Blue (#3478F6) and Ash Gray (#B0B4B9) gauges and line charts, creating a pulsating neon-like ambiance. Hector, wearing a charcoal-black RHEL cap, steps forward and unplugs an HDMI cable, causing the screens to snap to charcoal black (#1C1C1E). The room is now lit only by a single emergency light, casting long shadows and highlighting Wanjiru's tense posture. Hector's off-white ceramic mug sits on a cluttered oak table, with steam curling upwards, surrounded by scribbled post-its. The atmosphere shifts to a sudden hush, with a stark contrast between the former blue glare and the dim red EXIT sign.

#### Characters In Frame

1. **Hector**

   - **Appearance:** 49-year-old Mexican man, medium build, 5'10", weathered medium-brown complexion, angular face with a defined jawline, short, neatly trimmed salt-and-pepper beard. Intense hazel eyes with visible crow's feet, serious and analytical expression. Wearing a dark henley shirt, dark technical jeans, and a red RHEL baseball cap.
   - **Motion:** Intentional and focused energy, rarely gestures unless explaining failure.
   - **Props:** Stainless steel mechanical watch, ceramic black coffee mug, mechanical keyboard with no RGB lighting, leather notebook on desk.

2. **Wanjiru**

   - **Appearance:** 24-year-old woman, 5'1", petite with a youthful appearance, short natural hair dyed partially purple, dark brown eyes. Wearing smart business casual attire with colorful scarves, laptop adorned with stickers.
   - **Motion:** Tense posture, indicative of focus and concern.

#### Dialogue (Speech Bubbles)

- **Wanjiru:** (Off-white #EDEDED bubble, tail pointing to Wanjiru)\
  “Which panel actually tells me why the ATMs aren't working?”
- **Hector:** (Off-white #EDEDED bubble, tail pointing to Hector)\
  “Better black than blind. Start with what you know.”

#### Narration

- **Top-left corner of the panel, integrated within the scene:**\
  *“Dashboards stay green while customers decline—cognitive overload sets incident tone.”*
  - Narration box with a semi-transparent background for readability against the dim backdrop.

#### Visual Style

- Modern graphic-novel realism with clean, medium-weight lines and semi-realistic proportions.
- Eyes fully rendered with irises and reflections.
- Balanced lighting with the System Blue highlighting the initial dashboard glow, enhancing the focus on the transformation to darkness.
- Halftone backgrounds or shadows in subtle dot-screen patterns (variable density for depth).
- Hyper-saturated primaries for key elements (reds, blues, yellows); backgrounds may be muted but never mono-chrome.
- Thick, dynamic panel borders—slightly varied widths or inset panels for emphasis.
- Angular inking for dramatic shading; confident cross-hatching on folds and tech details.
- No explosive SFX graphics—keep onomatopoeia to minimal, realistic effects if at all.
- Minimal background clutter emphasizing the transition from illuminated dashboards to the dimly lit room.

#### Color Palette

- **Primary:** Charcoal Black #1C1C1E, System Blue #3478F6, Off-White #EDEDED
- **Supporting:** Ash Gray #B0B4B9, Yellow #FFDD00
- **Highlights:** Rust Red #8B2E2E

#### Constraints

- Characters arranged left-to-right consistent with speaking order: Wanjiru, Hector.
- Speech bubbles stay clear of panel edges and ambient elements like coffee steam.
- No motion blur, no watermarks, single widescreen panel suitable for enterprise training documentation.
- Ensure speech bubbles are not duplicated, and text is fully legible at final resolution.
- Narration is distinct and not within a speech bubble, with a semi-transparent background for readability.
