### Single-Panel Comic Prompt — “Log Context Revelation”

**Scene**  
- A close-up of Katherine’s expansive 32-inch monitor, split into two panes. The left pane displays rapid INFO lines in a dull gray, while the right pane features a single JSON log entry with fields color-coded: `trace_id` in System Blue (#3478F6) and `error` in Rust Red (#8B2E2E). Above the monitor, the Jaeger UI floats in an augmented-reality style, semi-transparent, showcasing waterfall bars in deep amber (#C97E38). An empty Red Bull can is precariously balanced on the monitor base, casting a fluorescent reflection that highlights Katherine’s furrowed brow.

**Dialogue (Speech Bubbles, Off-White #EDEDED, Tails Pointing to Speakers)**  
- **Katherine:** “The logs tell me nothing.”  
- **Hector:** “A log without context is a liar.”

**Narration**  
- Top-left corner of the panel, integrated within the scene:  
  *“Contextless logs hide divide-by-zero; OpenTelemetry schema unearths root cause.”*

**Visual Style**  
- Modern graphic-novel realism with clean, medium-weight lines and semi-realistic proportions.  
- Eyes fully rendered with irises and reflections.  
- Balanced lighting with System Blue and Rust Red highlighting key log fields, enhancing focus on the JSON entry.  
- Halftone backgrounds or shadows in subtle dot-screen patterns for depth.  
- Hyper-saturated primaries for key elements (reds, blues, yellows); backgrounds may be muted but never mono-chrome.  
- Thick, dynamic panel borders—slightly varied widths or inset panels for emphasis.  
- Angular inking for dramatic shading; confident cross-hatching on folds and tech details.  
- No explosive SFX graphics—keep onomatopoeia to minimal, realistic effects if at all.  
- Minimal background clutter emphasizing the monitor display and character expressions.

**Color Palette**  
- **Primary:** Charcoal Black #1C1C1E, System Blue #3478F6, Off-White #EDEDED  
- **Supporting:** Ash Gray #B0B4B9, Yellow #FFDD00  
- **Highlights:** Rust Red #8B2E2E, Deep Amber #C97E38

**Constraints**  
- Characters arranged left-to-right consistent with speaking order: Katherine, Hector, Juana.  
- Speech bubbles stay clear of panel edges and ambient elements.  
- No motion blur, no watermarks, single widescreen panel suitable for enterprise training documentation.  
- Ensure speech bubbles are not duplicated, and text is fully legible at final resolution.  
- Narration is distinct and not within a speech bubble, with a semi-transparent background for readability.
