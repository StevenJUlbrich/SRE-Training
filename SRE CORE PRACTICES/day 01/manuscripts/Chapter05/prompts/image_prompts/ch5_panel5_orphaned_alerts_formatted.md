### Single-Panel Comic Prompt — “Alert Triage”

#### Scene

- Juana's smartphone is prominently displayed in the foreground, with a dark-mode alert banner pulsing in Rust Red (#8B2E2E) reading ‘atm_txn_5xx_rate > 2%’. Her laptop screen in the background shows a 404 browser tab with a broken-page icon, emphasizing the issue at hand. Daniel is typing furiously on a charcoal keyboard, his terminal displaying curl checks returning 404 errors in red text. Sticky notes in System Blue (#3478F6) encircle a hastily drawn table labeled: Alert | URL | Owner. Above, a digital wall clock flips to 06:12, highlighting the urgency of the situation.

#### Visual Style

- Modern graphic-novel realism with clean, medium-weight lines and semi-realistic proportions.
- Eyes fully rendered with irises and reflections.
- Balanced lighting with Rust Red highlighting the alert banner, enhancing the focus on the urgency.
- Halftone backgrounds or shadows in subtle dot-screen patterns for depth.
- Hyper-saturated primaries for key elements (reds, blues, yellows); backgrounds may be muted but never mono-chrome.
- Thick, dynamic panel borders—slightly varied widths or inset panels for emphasis.
- Angular inking for dramatic shading; confident cross-hatching on folds and tech details.
- No explosive SFX graphics—keep onomatopoeia to minimal, realistic effects if at all.
- Minimal background clutter emphasizing the alert banner and character expressions.

#### Color Palette

- **Primary:** Charcoal Black #1C1C1E, System Blue #3478F6, Off-White #EDEDED
- **Supporting:** Ash Gray #B0B4B9, Yellow #FFDD00
- **Highlights:** Rust Red #8B2E2E

#### Constraints

- Characters arranged left-to-right consistent with speaking order: Juana, Hector.
- Speech bubbles stay clear of panel edges and ambient elements.
- No motion blur, no watermarks, single widescreen panel suitable for enterprise training documentation.
- Ensure speech bubbles are not duplicated, and text is fully legible at final resolution.
- Narration is distinct and not within a speech bubble, with a semi-transparent background for readability.
