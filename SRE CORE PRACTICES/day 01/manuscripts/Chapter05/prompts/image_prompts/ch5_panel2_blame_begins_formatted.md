### Single-Panel Comic Prompt — “Network Assumptions”

**Scene**

- The open-plan ops floor is bustling with activity. Daniel, with his sleeves rolled up, points assertively at a flat teal latency graph displayed on his matte-black monitor. Njeri, seated at a standing desk, swivels slightly to face Daniel, their terminal screen showing a bright System Blue mtr trace against a charcoal background. The fluorescent ceiling lights cast a soft glow on the polished concrete floor, while muted olive (#586E4B) cable bundles snake under the desks. A wall clock prominently displays the time as 05:07. Daniel's coffee cup is precariously tipped, spilling a thin line of Rust Red (#8B2E2E) across a notebook labeled ‘MPLS Incidents’.

**Narration**

- Top-left corner of the panel, integrated within the scene:\
  *“Network blame emerges despite clean metrics; Hector Alavaz challenges bias.”*

**Visual Style**

- The panel features modern graphic-novel realism with clean, medium-weight lines and semi-realistic proportions.
- Characters' eyes are fully rendered with irises and reflections, enhancing their expressive nature.
- Balanced lighting highlights the System Blue on Njeri's terminal, drawing attention to the clean metrics.
- Halftone backgrounds or shadows are used in subtle dot-screen patterns, providing depth without clutter.
- Key elements are highlighted with hyper-saturated primaries (reds, blues, yellows), while backgrounds maintain a muted but never mono-chrome palette.
- Panel borders are thick and dynamic, with slightly varied widths to emphasize key interactions.
- Angular inking is used for dramatic shading, with confident cross-hatching on folds and tech details.
- No explosive SFX graphics; onomatopoeia is minimal and realistic.
- Background clutter is minimized to emphasize the characters and their interactions with the digital displays.
