### Single-Panel Comic Prompt — “Theatre of Operations”

#### Scene

- The room is dimly lit, transformed into a theatre-style setting. A projector casts a large Mermaid sequence diagram onto a 10-foot screen, with red Lava-Glow (#8B2E2E) tags marking each 'sin' beside the arrows. Rows of ops chairs are filled with team members, their faces illuminated by System Blue highlights from the screen. Hector Alavaz stands stage-right, using a laser pointer to trace delay minutes along a side timeline. Empty pizza boxes on a back table suggest a long shift.
