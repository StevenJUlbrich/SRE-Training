### Single-Panel Comic Prompt — “Lava-Proof Mandate”

#### Scene

- Close-up of a whiteboard now covered in System Blue (#3478F6) sticky notes, each labeled with an action item and bold Rust Red (#8B2E2E) checkmark. Hector Alavaz is pressing the final checkmark with a Rust Red marker, his cap brim low, casting a shadow over his eyes. A side screen displays an ATM dispensing $20, with cash notes illuminated by the off-white ATM light (#EDEDED). Omar clutches a notebook titled ‘Lava-Proof Checklist’. The room lighting shifts to a warm amber, signaling resolution.

#### Narration

  *“Chapter closes with accountability and a lava-proof mandate.”*

#### Visual Style

- Modern graphic-novel realism with clean, medium-weight lines and semi-realistic proportions.
- Eyes fully rendered with irises and reflections.
- Balanced lighting with warm amber tones to signal resolution.
- Halftone backgrounds or shadows in subtle dot-screen patterns (variable density for depth).
- Hyper-saturated primaries for key elements (reds, blues, yellows); backgrounds may be muted but never mono-chrome.
- Thick, dynamic panel borders—slightly varied widths or inset panels for emphasis.
- Angular inking for dramatic shading; confident cross-hatching on folds and tech details.
- No explosive SFX graphics—keep onomatopoeia to minimal, realistic effects if at all.
- Minimal background clutter emphasizing the whiteboard and character expressions.

#### Constraints

- Characters arranged left-to-right consistent with speaking order: Omar, Hector Alavaz.
- Speech bubbles stay clear of panel edges and ambient elements.
- No motion blur, no watermarks, single widescreen panel suitable for enterprise training documentation.
- Ensure speech bubbles are not duplicated, and text is fully legible at final resolution.
- Narration is distinct and not within a speech bubble, with a semi-transparent background for readability.
