### Single-Panel Comic Prompt — “SLI Recalibration”

#### Scene

- A glass conference wall serves as a whiteboard, featuring a funnel diagram sketched in System Blue lines. A Rust Red 'X' marks the Fee Calculation step. Aisha stands confidently, pointing with a stylus. Dual 27-inch monitors display side-by-side Grafana dashboards: the left panel shows a bright green 100% uptime badge, while the right panel displays a charcoal graph plunging to 0% success rate. Morning light diffuses through high windows, casting a gentle glow on muted olive potted plants on a shelf.

#### Characters In Frame

1. **Aisha** — 29-year-old woman, 5'8", tall with an elegant presence, wearing a colorful hijab and business attire, with deep brown eyes and rectangular glasses.

   - **Appearance:** Blends visual order and emotional clarity — the steady signal in alert noise.
   - **Motion:** Moves with grace, confident in pauses.
   - **Props:** Color-coded notebook.

2. **Hector** — 49-year-old man, medium build, 5'10", weathered medium-brown complexion, angular face with a defined jawline, short, neatly trimmed salt-and-pepper beard, intense hazel eyes with visible crow's feet, wearing a dark henley shirt, dark technical jeans, and a red RHEL baseball cap.

   - **Appearance:** Seasoned operations engineer, grounded and alert.
   - **Motion:** Intentional, focused energy; rarely gestures unless explaining failure.
   - **Props:** Stainless steel mechanical watch, ceramic black coffee mug, mechanical keyboard with no RGB lighting, leather notebook on desk.

3. **Wanjiru** — 24-year-old woman, 5'1", petite with a youthful appearance, short natural hair dyed partially purple, dark brown eyes, wearing smart business casual attire with colorful scarves, laptop adorned with stickers.

#### Dialogue (speech bubbles, off-white #EDEDED, tails pointing to speakers)

- **Aisha:** “Our definition of 'healthy' forgot the human.”
- **Hector:** “SLIs measure promises, not pulses.”

#### Narration

- Top-left corner of the panel, integrated within the scene:\
  *“Team pivots from raw uptime to customer-success SLI.”*

#### Visual Style

- Modern graphic-novel realism with clean, medium-weight lines and semi-realistic proportions.
- Eyes fully rendered with irises and reflections.
- Balanced lighting with System Blue highlighting the funnel diagram, enhancing focus on the recalibration process.
- Halftone backgrounds or shadows in subtle dot-screen patterns (variable density for depth).
- Hyper-saturated primaries for key elements (reds, blues, yellows); backgrounds may be muted but never mono-chrome.
- Thick, dynamic panel borders—slightly varied widths or inset panels for emphasis.
- Angular inking for dramatic shading; confident cross-hatching on folds and tech details.
- No explosive SFX graphics—keep onomatopoeia to minimal, realistic effects if at all.
- Minimal background clutter emphasizing the conference wall and character expressions.

#### Color Palette

- **Primary:** Charcoal Black #1C1C1E, System Blue #3478F6, Off-White #EDEDED
- **Supporting:** Ash Gray #B0B4B9, Yellow #FFDD00
- **Highlights:** Rust Red #8B2E2E

#### Constraints

- Characters arranged left-to-right consistent with speaking order: Aisha, Hector, Wanjiru.
- Speech bubbles stay clear of panel edges and ambient elements.
- No motion blur, no watermarks, single widescreen panel suitable for enterprise training documentation.
- Ensure speech bubbles are not duplicated, and text is fully legible at final resolution.
- Narration is distinct and not within a speech bubble, with a semi-transparent background for readability.
