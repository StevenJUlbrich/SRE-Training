## ✅ MASTER CHAPTER GENERATION PROMPT – CHAPTER 5

You are generating Chapter 5 of an illustrated, instructional novella about observability and SRE maturity in banking systems. This chapter catalogs common anti-patterns that undermine observability, framed around a regional ATM outage.

### ❌ DO NOT:

- Add panels beyond the 10 defined in the outline
- Add quizzes, labs, or bonus scenes
- Include characters not in the provided cast
- Break structure or pacing rules in the contract
- Invent new observability “sins” outside the defined five

______________________________________________________________________

### 🧱 STRUCTURE:

Start with:

```markdown
# Chapter 5 – “Patterns to Avoid Like Volcanoes”
```

Then follow the section structure from `authoring_contract_hector_v2.yaml`. Each panel must:

- Align to the beat-to-concept map in `chapter_5_outline.md`
- Include a 1–2 paragraph scene and dialogue (minimum)
- Integrate technical artifacts (CLI/code/logs/diagram) as defined
- Include one properly styled widget per teaching sequence (reflection, debug, try this, etc.)

Target **12,000–18,000 narrative words**, excluding CLI/code blocks.

______________________________________________________________________

### ✍️ STYLE & VOICE:

- Hector Alavaz’s tone: dry, incisive, slightly intimidating
- Cast behavior must reflect the pressure of a high-stakes ATM outage
- Let frustration, confusion, and relief all show up through actions and internal monologue
- Keep scenes cinematic but always tied to the teaching goals

______________________________________________________________________

### 🧠 INTRODUCTION REQUIREMENTS

The Chapter Overview must:

- Be 5 paragraphs
- Explain what observability anti-patterns are
- Introduce the idea of the “Five Sins” with real impact
- Establish banking-specific regulatory consequences for telemetry gaps
- Set up the incident as a learning moment—not a tech demo

______________________________________________________________________

### 🧪 VALIDATION CHECKLIST (POST-GENERATION)

Ensure:

- Panel count = 10
- One widget per teaching sequence is embedded
- All five sins are illustrated in panels 4–8
- Narrative length = 12,000–18,000 (excluding code blocks)
- Chapter overview is 5 paragraphs, grounded in real banking ops
- Characters stay in-voice and show learning and accountability

______________________________________________________________________

### 🧪 BEGIN GENERATION:

Do not invent structure or characters. Generate using the teaching arc in the outline.
Start from:

```markdown
# Chapter 5 – “Patterns to Avoid Like Volcanoes”
```

Continue through all 10 panels. End with a postmortem reflection, an assessment hook, and Hector Alavaz’s closing line.
