# Chapter 1 – “The Site Is Down” Isn’t a Root Cause  

---

## Chapter Overview  
It’s 02:17 on a Saturday. Millions of card-present payments in East Africa stall in the authorization queue, but the status dashboard at Kenya-Metro Bank is lit up in cheerful shades of teal. If you take the board at face value, everything is perfect—CPU is cruising at 37 %, latency is a placid 90 ms, and the error counter reads a reassuring **0**. Unfortunately, the VP of Digital Channels is awake, the call-centre phones are screaming, and Hector Alvarez’s pager has just detonated on his night-stand.  

This opening incident frames the most dangerous observability trap in highly-regulated banking: believing that “all-green” equals “all-clear.” Legacy monitoring (think Geneos) rewards pretty SLA dials; modern reliability demands telemetry that **confesses**. In the next seven panels you’ll watch Hector dismantle a rainbow dashboard, expose a hidden avalanche of HTTP 500s, and hammer home why logs, metrics, *and* traces must overlap before anyone can utter the words “root cause.”  

Along the way you’ll meet Wanjiru Maina (junior dev on call), Manu Gitonga (battle-worn support hero), and Juana Torres (alert whisperer). Their mis-steps are authentic: staring at the wrong metric, ignoring dead-silent logs, trusting a colour palette over customer pain. By the end of Chapter 1 you’ll be able to spot those mistakes in your own environment—and teach your systems to rat themselves out before the compliance auditor does.

### 🎯 Learning Objective  
Demonstrate how superficially “healthy” dashboards can mask catastrophic service failures and explain, through a real banking-payment outage, how triangulating **metrics + logs + traces** reveals the actionable root cause.  

### ✅ Takeaway  
If your users are shouting and your dashboard is smiling, the dashboard is lying—instrument until the system can’t keep secrets.  

### 🚦 Applied Example  
At 02:17 the **payment-service** starts returning HTTP 500 for every transaction signed with a Kenya-issued Visa debit card. Geneos sends a half-hearted CPU notice (57 % spike) but no error alert because the error-rate metric was filtered to “> 5 % of total traffic.” Debit traffic is only 3 % overnight, so the threshold never triggers.  

Finance sees 11 453 “Settlement Failed” rows in the ledger export. In the logs, however, the only clue is a single-line stack trace stripped of context:

```shell
2025-04-30T02:17:08Z payment-service ERROR internal.DbException: ledger-write timeout (3 s) [requestId=-]
```

No `trace_id`, no tenant ID, no customer PAN hash—nothing Juana can pivot on. A quick OpenTelemetry query (`payment-service latency p95 by span`) returns **no data**; tracing was never enabled for writes outside business hours to “save quota.” By 02:22, card-present decline rates hit 98 %, merchants switch to cash reserve, and the regulator hotline rings. This “invisible outage” cost KSh 4.2 million in uncollected interchange fees and an unplanned 8-hour incident review with the Central Bank. All because “error rate < 5 %” looked green. (≈ 170 words)

## Teaching Narrative – Part A (Panels 1 – 3)  

### Panel 1 – *The Pager Screams*  
Wanjiru flinches as Hector storms into the dim NOC, pager still buzzing in his fist. Slack channels glow *“PAYMENT_FAILURE_ALERT”* while the wall dashboard rolls soothing gradients of green.  

> **Hector:** “Green dashboards and screaming users—pick a side.”  
> **Wanjiru:** “But look — authorisation success is **100 %** on the board!”  
> **Hector:** “No, the board is measuring hope. Hope isn’t telemetry.”  
> **Wanjiru:** “Then what’s really breaking?”  

Hector scans a secondary terminal, fingers drumming. A quick `curl` returns `HTTP/500` with the body: `{"error":"ledger-timeout"}`. Human 1 – Dashboard 0.

### Panel 2 – *Panic at Geneos*  
Manu is hunched over the legacy Geneos console; red blips sporadically flash around *cpu-bank-01*, yet the summary dial reads **“Overall Health: GOOD.”**  

> **Manu:** “CPU spikes look normal, disk IO is steady. Maybe the switch is flaky?”  
> **Hector:** “You’re fishing. Stop admiring averages; start finding outliers.”  
> **Manu:** “Alright… show me a metric that *proves* user pain.”  
> **Hector:** “Transactions per second, partitioned by `card_type`. If debit’s flatlining, the colour wheel means nothing.”  

Hector pivots the Grafana query: `sum(rate(payment_success_total{card_type="debit"}[1m]))`. The graph flatlines at **0 TPS**. Geneos never broke threshold because debit volume is low after midnight.

### Panel 3 – *What’s Actually Broken?*  
Juana tails the live log for **payment-service**; every line is “ledger-write timeout,” but crucial context fields are `null`. No correlation IDs, no customer identifiers, no service span.  

> **Juana:** “Logs give me nothing—trace IDs were stripped in last week’s PR.”  
> **Hector:** “Brilliant. We built a smoke alarm that turns itself off at night.”  
> **Juana:** “I can’t even tell *which* ledger shard timed out.”  
> **Hector:** “Then we start with the evidence we *do* have—timeouts point to DB or network. Pull the saturation graphs for shard 07.”  

Juana’s quick check: `pg_stat_activity` on shard 07 shows 96 idle transactions waiting on lock `ledger_write`; query latency 9 s. That’s the bottleneck the “all-green” board forgot to mention.

:::system-failure-anecdote  
*Six months ago the same ledger cluster hit its connection ceiling during a holiday sale. Nobody noticed until marketing tweeted “Record revenue hour!” Meanwhile, 40 % of cart checkouts silently rolled back. Lesson learned? Telemetry that won’t embarrass you in front of Finance is useless.*

## Teaching Narrative – Part C (Panels 6 – 7)

### Panel 6 – *Connecting the Dots*  
Hector grabs a dry-erase marker and sketches three interlocking circles on the NOC whiteboard—*Metrics*, *Logs*, *Traces*.

> **Hector:** “Root cause isn’t a single circle. It’s the overlap.”  
> **Wanjiru:** “So the missing trace ID killed our overlap?”  
> **Hector:** “Exactly. A Venn diagram with a hole in the middle tells you where to instrument next.”

:::try-this  
Pull a recent incident from your own environment.  
1. List the **first metric** that signalled trouble.  
2. Note the **log entry** that proved something was wrong.  
3. Identify any **trace** that pinpointed latency or failure.  
Sketch a Venn diagram like Hector’s. Wherever an intersection is blank, you’ve uncovered an observability blind spot—instrument it this week.

### Panel 7 – *Dashboard Confession*  
Juana reruns the Grafana board—now filtered by `card_type="debit"` and correlated with a fresh trace overlay. Error rate spikes in crimson; debit TPS is flat; a trace waterfall highlights 9 s writes on ledger shard 07.

> **Juana:** “Green’s gone. The board is finally *honest*.”  
> **Hector:** “Good dashboards don’t cheer you up—they confess.”  
> **Manu:** “Row-level lock on shard 07 confirmed. Vacuum job in five minutes.”  
> **Wanjiru:** “Lesson learned: ‘site down’ is a symptom, not a diagnosis.”

![Panel 7 – Realisation](images/ch1_p7_lesson.png){width=600}

:::reflection  
Think back to your last outage. How many minutes were spent **collecting** data versus **interpreting** it? Write one concrete action you’ll take to close that gap—new metric, enriched log, or always-on tracing flag.
