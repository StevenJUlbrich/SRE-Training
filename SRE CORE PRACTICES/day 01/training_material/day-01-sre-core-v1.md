## 🔧 Let’s Build Out: **🧱 Day 1 — Intro to Observability & SRE**

**Character:** Hector — The Veteran SRE  
**Style:** Gruff, been paged too many times, teaches using systems, scars, and diagrams  
**Vibe:** “Let me tell you how this broke *last* time.”

# 🧠 Day 1: Foundations of Observability

### 👤 **Character Intro: Hector – Mexico City**
> “People think observability is about tools. It’s not. It’s about seeing clearly in chaos.  
> I don’t chase issues—I wait for the system to confess.”

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

### 🔍 Beginner
- Understand the 3 Pillars of Observability: Metrics, Logs, Traces
- Differentiate Monitoring vs Observability

### 🧩 Intermediate
- Learn how unknown unknowns are detected through observability
- Understand signal fidelity and the power of triangulation

### 💡 SRE-Level
- Model observability maturity
- Design a basic architecture for integrated signals

---

## 💥 Incident Hook: “The One Where Everything Looked Fine”

> “One day, the order API crashed… but every graph looked green.  
> We had alerts, logs, and dashboards—and *no clue what was happening*.  
> Took us 6 hours. What did we learn? You can’t monitor what you don’t understand.”

## 🔍 Core Concepts

### 🔹 Observability vs Monitoring

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Monitoring] --> B[Predefined Metrics]
    A --> C[Alerts Based on Thresholds]
    D[Observability] --> B
    D --> C
    D --> E[Exploration & Unknown Unknowns]
```

📝 **Monitoring** = Alert on what you know  
🧠 **Observability** = Ask *new* questions when things break

### 🔹 The 3 Pillars of Observability

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    O(Observability) --> M(Metrics)
    O --> L(Logs)
    O --> T(Traces)
    M --> I[Performance Insight]
    L --> I
    T --> I
```

- **Metrics** = Quantitative snapshots over time
- **Logs** = Discrete events or messages
- **Traces** = Request journey through systems

🗨️ *“Metrics say ‘something’s wrong’. Logs say ‘what happened’. Traces say ‘where it broke’.”*

### 🔹 Maturity Model: From Nagios to Nirvana

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Basic Monitoring] --> B[Enhanced Monitoring]
    B --> C[Partial Observability]
    C --> D[Full Observability]
```

📌 Full observability = consistent signal collection, ID propagation, cross-pillar correlation

---

## 🧰 Tools You Might Use
(no install required—descriptive only)
- Prometheus: Metrics collection  
- Fluentbit: Log forwarding  
- Jaeger: Distributed tracing  
- Grafana: Unified dashboards  
- Splunk, Datadog, Dynatrace: Commercial platforms

🛑 These are **examples**, not prerequisites.

---

## 🔬 Exercises (Simulation Mode)

### Scenario:
You are handed 3 screenshots:
1. CPU graph: Normal
2. Log sample: `200 OK` for all requests
3. Trace: Missing spans between frontend and auth service

📌 **Question:** Which pillar is lying? What’s likely happening?  
📌 **Bonus:** What would you add to improve signal fidelity?

---

## 💀 Common Pitfalls

- Thinking logs alone will explain latency  
- Monitoring host metrics but not application metrics  
- No correlation IDs → no cross-signal tracing  
- Alerting only on thresholds, not behaviors

---

## 📜 Hector’s Commandments

1. “If it can’t be traced, it’s hiding something.”  
2. “Green dashboards lie.”  
3. “Observability is not a product. It’s a practice.”

## 🤝 Handoff to Tomorrow

> “Metrics are your first lens into any system. Tomorrow, Felix will show you how to build real-time signal detectors that don’t just bark—they tell you where to look.”

Want me to generate the PNG versions from the Mermaid code blocks next (for your Kroki setup)?  
Or go straight into building Day 2 using Felix the metrics snob?

Your system. Your call. I just run the logs.
