üìù Final Invocation
Create a comprehensive, hands-on Day 2 training module on implementing observability tools and techniques (metrics, logs, traces) for production support professionals transitioning to SRE roles.
As an expert SRE instructor, develop practical content that builds directly on Day 1's foundational concepts, moving from theory to implementation with detailed code examples, configuration guides, and step-by-step walkthroughs. The material should use clear architecture diagrams, Python implementations, and compelling "implementation war stories" to illustrate both successes and pitfalls.
Structure the content with tiered implementation guidance for different experience levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced/SRE) and include practical examples relevant to their current environments (VSI, Kubernetes, AWS). Provide migration strategies from existing tools (Geneos, Splunk, Dynatrace, Datadog) to modern observability stacks.
