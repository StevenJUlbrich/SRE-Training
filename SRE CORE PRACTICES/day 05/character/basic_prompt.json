She carries herself with calm precision, often wearing dark tailored pants paired with jewel-toned shirts and her signature blue cardigan embroidered with subtle cloud patterns. Her workspace is distinguished by multiple monitors displaying unified dashboards, a small black notebook filled with system diagrams, and a yellow rubber duck named \"Murphy\" that she consults during complex problem-solving sessions. During incidents, Mei moves with deliberate efficiency, her expression remaining composed as she methodically correlates alerts across systems while her quick fingers navigate through monitoring tools. When teaching others about integration and triage, her eyes light up with enthusiasm as she demonstrates her \"Ask better questions, get better alerts\" philosophy through practical scenarios and RED method dashboards.",
