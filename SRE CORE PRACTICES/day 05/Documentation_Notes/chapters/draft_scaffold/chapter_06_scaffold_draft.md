# Chapter 6: Evidence-Based Investigation Techniques

## Panel 1: The Scientific Method for Incidents - From Observation to Theory
### Scene Description

 A banking war room where a systematic investigation of a trade settlement failure is underway. The front wall displays a structured investigation framework modeled on the scientific method. Team members work through clearly defined stages: Recording objective observations on digital notepads (unusual error patterns in settlement confirmations), formulating multiple hypotheses on a shared board (API rate limiting, data validation issues, timing problems), designing specific tests for each theory, and methodically executing these tests while documenting results. A senior SRE named Omar guides the team, repeatedly redirecting discussions from speculation back to evidence, asking "What do we know for certain?" and "How can we test that theory?" The team adds each verified finding to a growing evidence map, building a fact-based picture of the incident while rigorously distinguishing between confirmed facts and unverified theories.

### Teaching Narrative
Traditional troubleshooting often relies on intuition and past experience, jumping quickly to solutions based on surface similarities to previous incidents. Integration & Triage introduces a transformative approach based on the scientific method—a rigorous, evidence-based framework that transforms investigations from intuitive leaps to methodical inquiry. This approach follows a systematic progression: careful observation of system behavior, formulation of multiple competing hypotheses that might explain these observations, design of specific tests to evaluate each hypothesis, methodical execution of these tests, and evidence-based conclusions that guide further investigation or remediation. For complex banking systems where incorrect diagnoses can lead to unnecessary changes that introduce new risks, this scientific rigor prevents premature conclusions based on incomplete evidence. Developing this evidence-based mindset requires deliberately slowing down the rush to solution, creating space for methodical investigation despite pressure to resolve quickly. The discipline to distinguish between observation and interpretation, to consider multiple possible explanations, and to verify theories through deliberate testing rather than assumption represents a profound evolution in your troubleshooting approach. This transformation from experience-based intuition to evidence-based investigation significantly improves diagnostic accuracy, particularly for novel or complex issues where pattern recognition alone may lead to incorrect conclusions.

## Panel 2: The Theory of Constraints - Finding the Critical Bottleneck
### Scene Description

 A banking performance engineering team investigates a trading platform slowdown affecting thousands of customers. The room's main display shows a complex system flow diagram with transaction paths across multiple services. Team members apply the Theory of Constraints methodology, systematically identifying and measuring throughput at each processing stage. Data visualizations show where transactions flow smoothly and where they accumulate, with dramatic queuing visible before a specific authentication validation step despite abundant capacity elsewhere in the system. An engineer circles this constraint on the diagram and calculates that even a modest 15% improvement at this single point would improve end-to-end performance by 40%, while enhancements to other components would yield negligible benefits. The team shifts their entire focus to this constraint, developing both immediate relief measures and longer-term architectural changes specifically targeting this bottleneck.

### Teaching Narrative
Traditional performance investigation often attempts to improve multiple system components simultaneously, spreading effort across various optimization opportunities without clear prioritization. Integration & Triage introduces the Theory of Constraints—a focused analytical approach that transforms performance investigations by identifying the single critical bottleneck limiting overall system throughput. This methodology recognizes that in complex banking systems, performance is almost always constrained by one dominant bottleneck at any given time; improving other components yields minimal benefits until this primary constraint is addressed. The Theory of Constraints provides a systematic framework: identify the system's constraint, exploit the constraint through immediate optimization, subordinate other processes to the constraint's needs, elevate the constraint through more substantial improvements, and finally iterate the process when a new constraint emerges. For financial platforms where milliseconds impact customer experience and trading opportunities, this focused approach delivers maximum performance improvement with minimal engineering effort. Developing this constraint-focused mindset requires resisting the temptation to pursue multiple optimizations simultaneously, instead concentrating resources on scientifically identified bottlenecks. This transformation from diffuse to focused performance engineering represents a significant evolution in your troubleshooting efficiency, allowing your team to achieve dramatic improvements through precisely targeted interventions rather than scattered optimization efforts.

## Panel 3: The Differential Diagnosis Method - Systematic Problem Isolation
### Scene Description

 A banking security operations center investigating an unusual pattern of authentication failures across multiple systems. A whiteboard displays a comprehensive differential diagnosis matrix with columns for different potential causes (credential database corruption, network latency, API throttling, security controls, client application issues) and rows listing various tests and expected outcomes for each theory. Team members systematically work through this matrix, conducting specific diagnostic tests and documenting results that either support or contradict each potential cause. As evidence accumulates, they eliminate theories that don't match observed behavior, progressively narrowing the investigation. A color-coding system tracks confidence levels for each diagnostic path. The team leader updates the matrix after each test, visually demonstrating how the evidence increasingly points to a specific client application version as the root cause, despite initial assumptions pointing toward infrastructure issues.

### Teaching Narrative
Traditional troubleshooting often follows a linear path, pursuing a single hypothesis until proven incorrect before moving to alternatives—a time-consuming approach when the initial theory is wrong. Integration & Triage introduces differential diagnosis—a systematic method borrowed from medicine that transforms investigations by evaluating multiple potential causes simultaneously. This approach recognizes that complex banking incidents typically have several plausible explanations, each requiring different evidence to confirm or refute. Differential diagnosis provides a structured framework: enumerate all reasonable potential causes, identify specific tests or evidence that would distinguish between these causes, methodically collect this evidence, and progressively eliminate theories that contradict observed system behavior. For financial systems where rapid resolution is critical, this parallel investigation approach significantly reduces mean time to diagnosis by preventing extended pursuit of incorrect theories. Developing this systematic mindset requires deliberately maintaining multiple competing hypotheses rather than committing to a favorite explanation, designing specific tests with discriminating power between theories, and objectively evaluating evidence even when it contradicts initial assumptions. This transformation from sequential to parallel investigation represents a significant evolution in your diagnostic efficiency, ensuring faster identification of true root causes by simultaneously evaluating all plausible explanations rather than investigating them one after another.

## Panel 4: Incident Archaeology - Reconstructing the Sequence of Events
### Scene Description

 A banking forensic investigation team reconstructs a complex data consistency incident that affected customer account balances. The investigation space resembles an archaeological dig site, with layers of evidence organized chronologically on a digital timeline spanning multiple displays. Team members meticulously reconstruct the incident sequence, gathering timestamps from diverse sources: deployment logs, configuration changes, database transaction records, application events, and user actions. Like archaeologists piecing together ancient events, they establish a precise chronology, identifying exact timing relationships between seemingly unrelated actions. A specialized visualization shows how a sequence of individually benign events—a schema migration, routine failover test, configuration update, and caching change—created a rare race condition when combined in a specific order. The team carefully documents each piece of evidence supporting this reconstruction, creating a definitive timeline that explains exactly how the incident unfolded.

### Teaching Narrative
Traditional incident analysis often focuses primarily on the final failure state, giving limited attention to the precise sequence of events that created the conditions for failure. Integration & Triage introduces incident archaeology—the meticulous reconstruction of event sequences to transform investigations from state-based to history-based analysis. This approach recognizes that in complex banking systems, incidents rarely result from single failures but instead emerge from specific sequences of events that interact in unexpected ways. Incident archaeology provides a systematic methodology: gathering timestamped evidence from all relevant sources, establishing precise chronological relationships, identifying causal connections between events, and reconstructing the complete incident narrative from initial conditions through final impact. For financial systems where understanding exact timing relationships can reveal subtle race conditions or transaction inconsistencies, this historical reconstruction becomes particularly valuable. Developing this archaeological mindset requires painstaking evidence collection across system boundaries, precise timestamp correlation despite clock differences, and careful validation of event sequences through multiple data sources. This transformation from state-focused to sequence-focused analysis represents a significant evolution in your investigative capabilities, revealing how specific event combinations and timing relationships create complex failure modes that remain invisible when examining only the final system state.

## Panel 5: The Five Whys - Drilling to Root Causes
### Scene Description

 A banking post-incident review where team members analyze a critical payment gateway failure. Rather than stopping at the immediate technical cause, the facilitator guides a structured "Five Whys" process, repeatedly asking "Why?" to drill deeper into each causal layer. A whiteboard shows their progression: Why did transactions fail? Because the payment gateway timed out. Why did it time out? Because the database connection pool was exhausted. Why was the pool exhausted? Because connection leaks accumulated over time. Why weren't leaks detected? Because connection monitoring was disabled. Why was monitoring disabled? Because it was temporarily turned off during performance testing and never restored. This final "why" reveals the true systemic root cause—inadequate change management processes—that allowed a temporary test configuration to persist into production. The team's body language shows the progressive revelation as each "why" takes them further from technical symptoms toward the fundamental organizational and process issues that enabled the incident.

### Teaching Narrative
Traditional problem-solving often stops at the immediate technical cause—the specific component or code that failed—without investigating the deeper conditions that allowed the failure to occur. Integration & Triage introduces the Five Whys technique—a structured inquiry method that transforms investigations from superficial fix-finding to true root cause identification. This approach recognizes that in banking systems, surface-level failures usually stem from deeper systemic issues that, if left unaddressed, will generate similar incidents through different manifestations. The Five Whys provides a deceptively simple but powerful framework: for each identified cause, ask "Why did this happen?" approximately five times (the exact number varies), with each answer forming the basis for the next question. This progressive drilling typically moves from technical failures to process weaknesses, organizational issues, or cultural factors that represent the true root cause. For financial institutions where regulatory compliance requires addressing fundamental issues rather than symptoms, this depth of analysis is essential for genuine problem resolution. Developing this persistent inquiry mindset requires resisting the natural tendency to stop at technically convenient answers, instead continuing to probe until reaching causes that, if corrected, would prevent entire classes of similar failures. This transformation from symptom treatment to systemic improvement represents a significant evolution in your problem-solving approach, addressing the conditions that enable failures rather than merely responding to their immediate manifestations.

## Panel 6: Falsifiability and the Danger of Confirmation Bias
### Scene Description

 A banking incident room split to illustrate two investigation approaches to the same mysterious database performance issue. On one side, an engineer falls victim to confirmation bias, selectively focusing on evidence supporting his initial theory about index fragmentation while dismissing contradicting signals. His workstation shows cherry-picked metrics that align with his hypothesis while minimizing others. On the opposite side, a team follows falsification principles, deliberately designing tests that could prove their leading theory wrong. Their whiteboard lists specific predictions: "If our theory about index fragmentation is correct, we should see X, Y, and Z when we run these queries." When test results contradict these predictions, they immediately acknowledge the theory is flawed rather than trying to force-fit the evidence. The contrast between the two approaches is stark—one seeking confirmation and becoming increasingly entrenched despite contrary evidence, the other actively testing assumptions and quickly adapting when evidence contradicts their initial theory.

### Teaching Narrative
Traditional troubleshooting psychology often leads investigators to unconsciously seek evidence confirming their initial theories while discounting contradictory signals—a cognitive trap known as confirmation bias. Integration & Triage introduces falsifiability as a core principle—deliberately testing theories by attempting to disprove them rather than confirm them. This approach recognizes that human minds naturally seek validation for existing beliefs, creating dangerous blind spots during complex investigations. Falsifiability transforms your diagnostic mindset from "How can I prove my theory correct?" to "How could I prove my theory wrong?"—a subtle but powerful shift that dramatically improves objectivity. For banking systems where incorrect diagnoses can lead to unnecessary changes that introduce new risks, this intellectual discipline prevents attachment to flawed theories despite mounting contradictory evidence. Developing this falsification mindset requires deliberately formulating specific, testable predictions for each theory, designing experiments specifically capable of disproving your leading hypotheses, and maintaining genuine openness to abandoning theories when evidence contradicts them. This transformation from confirmation-seeking to falsification-testing represents a significant evolution in your investigative objectivity, ensuring theories survive because they withstand rigorous testing rather than because evidence was selectively interpreted to support them.

## Panel 7: Collaborative Evidence Building - Leveraging Collective Intelligence
### Scene Description

 A major banking incident investigation where multiple teams converge in both physical and virtual spaces to build collective understanding. The focal point is a shared, real-time investigation board accessible to all participants regardless of location. Different specialists contribute evidence from their domains: database experts add query performance data, network engineers contribute traffic analysis, application developers provide error pattern insights, and security analysts assess potential threat vectors. The collaborative workspace allows these diverse perspectives to combine into comprehensive understanding no individual could achieve alone. Visualization tools automatically identify connections between contributions from different specialists, highlighting interdependencies that would remain invisible in siloed investigation. A facilitator orchestrates this collaboration, ensuring all perspectives receive attention while maintaining focus on evidence rather than assumptions. The collective intelligence of the group systematically eliminates incorrect theories while building a holistic picture of the incident that incorporates multidisciplinary insights.

### Teaching Narrative
Traditional incident investigation often occurs in technical silos, with specialists examining their own domains without effectively integrating perspectives across disciplines. Integration & Triage introduces collaborative evidence building—a structured approach that transforms investigations from fragmented individual efforts to cohesive team intelligence. This methodology recognizes that in modern banking environments with highly distributed, interdependent systems, complete understanding requires combining insights across specializations that no single individual fully comprehends. Collaborative investigation provides a systematic framework: creating shared evidence spaces accessible to all contributors, actively integrating diverse technical perspectives, visualizing connections between findings from different domains, and building collective understanding that exceeds what any individual could develop alone. For financial systems where incidents frequently cross boundaries between database, application, network, and security domains, this multidisciplinary approach becomes particularly valuable. Developing this collaborative mindset requires both technical tools that facilitate shared investigation and cultural practices that value diverse perspectives, actively seek contradictory viewpoints, and systematically integrate specialized knowledge into comprehensive understanding. This transformation from siloed to integrated investigation represents a significant evolution in your diagnostic capabilities, leveraging your organization's collective expertise to understand complex, cross-domain incidents that would remain partially invisible when examined through any single technical lens.
