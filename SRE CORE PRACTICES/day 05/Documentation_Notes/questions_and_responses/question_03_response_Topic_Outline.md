# SRE Training: Integration & Triage for Banking Professionals

## Chapter Outline

### Chapter 1: From Monitoring to Integration & Triage - The Mindset Shift
An introduction to the evolution from traditional monitoring to integration and triage practices, focusing on the fundamental paradigm shift from reactive alerting to proactive signal integration and systematic response. Establishes the foundation for banking professionals to understand how their existing skills translate to SRE practices. Explores the critical differences between monitoring dashboards and true observability, introducing the concept of "The Green Wall Fallacy" where systems appear healthy despite customer-impacting issues. Concludes with a framework for developing an evidence-based mindset essential for effective triage in complex financial systems.

### Chapter 2: The Signal Landscape - Understanding Data Sources
Explores the four pillars of observability signals (metrics, logs, traces, and events) in banking systems, detailing how to identify, collect, and initially interpret these signals across disparate monitoring platforms. Demonstrates how to transition from siloed monitoring views to a holistic understanding of system behavior across payment processing, trading platforms, and digital banking channels. Addresses the unique challenges of working with legacy banking systems that may lack modern instrumentation alongside cloud-native applications. Provides practical techniques for enhancing signal quality and establishing baseline behaviors for critical financial services.

### Chapter 3: Alert Classification and Initial Response
Covers frameworks for categorizing and prioritizing alerts based on customer impact, financial implications, and regulatory concerns in banking environments. Teaches systematic approaches to initial response, including validating alerts, gathering context, and documenting findings in a banking environment with complex dependencies. Introduces triage protocols specifically designed for different classes of financial services (retail banking, investment platforms, payment processing) with their varying SLA requirements and business impacts. Provides practical workflows for the crucial first 15 minutes of alert response that properly balance speed with thoroughness.

### Chapter 4: Correlation and Pattern Recognition
Introduces techniques for connecting seemingly disparate signals across distributed banking systems to identify patterns and potential root causes, emphasizing the unique challenges of financial transaction flows. Builds skills in distinguishing causal relationships from coincidental correlations, with examples from transaction processing, fraud detection, and third-party integration failures. Demonstrates effective methods for timeline construction during triage, particularly important when investigating issues that span multiple systems with different timestamp formats and time zones. Introduces basic statistical approaches to identifying anomalies in financial transaction patterns and system behaviors that may indicate emerging issues.

### Chapter 5: Escalation Protocols and Communication
Focuses on effective triage communication, proper escalation pathways, and handoff procedures within complex financial organizations with specialized teams and regulatory requirements. Addresses the unique challenges of navigating specialized teams across front-office, middle-office, and back-office functions while maintaining regulatory compliance during incident response. Provides frameworks for composing clear, actionable updates to stakeholders at different technical levels, ensuring transparency without causing unnecessary alarm to business and customer-facing teams. Covers the development of runbooks and decision trees that enable consistent escalation practices, even during high-stress situations.

### Chapter 6: Evidence-Based Investigation Techniques
Presents systematic troubleshooting methodologies that leverage empirical evidence rather than assumptions when investigating system disruptions in critical financial systems. Demonstrates how to perform controlled experiments and hypothesis testing during triage of banking systems where direct testing may be constrained by security and compliance requirements. Introduces the concept of "the scientific method for SRE" and provides structured approaches to narrowing down problem spaces in complex banking architectures. Covers techniques for effective investigation in environments with limited observability or restricted access due to security controls, common challenges in banking infrastructure.

### Chapter 7: Automation and Machine Learning in Triage
Explores advanced approaches to automating triage functions through rule-based systems, anomaly detection, and machine learning applications in financial services. Shows how to develop and implement automation while maintaining appropriate human oversight for critical financial systems where automated decisions carry significant risk. Provides practical examples of progressive automation, starting with simple correlation rules and advancing to sophisticated anomaly detection systems that can identify potential issues before they impact customers. Addresses the regulatory considerations and necessary governance frameworks when implementing automated decision systems in regulated financial environments.

### Chapter 8: Measuring and Improving Triage Effectiveness
Concludes with frameworks for quantitatively assessing triage performance and implementing continuous improvement processes aligned with financial and customer experience metrics. Covers measurement approaches such as Mean Time To Identify (MTTI), triage accuracy rates, and escalation effectiveness, connecting these improvements to customer satisfaction, regulatory compliance, and financial outcomes. Introduces techniques for conducting effective post-triage reviews that focus on process improvement rather than blame. Provides guidance on building a learning organization that systematically improves triage capabilities through knowledge sharing, simulation exercises, and continuous refinement of response protocols.

This chapter progression creates a logical learning journey that builds systematically from fundamental concepts to advanced practices, specifically addressing the transition from production support to SRE roles in banking environments.
