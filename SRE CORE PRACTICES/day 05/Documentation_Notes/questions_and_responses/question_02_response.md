# Defining Integration & Triage for SRE Training Materials

## 1. Scope and Boundaries of Integration & Triage

Integration & Triage in the SRE context can be defined as:

The systematic process of collecting, correlating, prioritizing, and responding to signals from various monitoring systems to effectively identify, diagnose, and resolve service disruptions. This discipline bridges the gap between traditional monitoring approaches and comprehensive observability practices.

**Boundaries include:**
- Begins at signal collection and alert generation
- Extends through initial response, investigation, and classification
- Includes routing to appropriate teams/individuals
- Ends at the handoff to incident management for major issues or resolution for minor ones
- Excludes deep application debugging and code fixes
- Excludes post-incident review processes (though feeds into them)

## 2. Core Principles and Concepts to Cover

### Foundational Level:
- Signal types: metrics, logs, traces, and events
- Alert classification and prioritization frameworks
- False positive/negative identification
- Basic correlation techniques across monitoring systems
- Initial response protocols and documentation
- Effective communication during triage

### Intermediate Level:
- Service dependency mapping and impact assessment
- Systematic troubleshooting methodologies
- Evidence-based investigation techniques
- Causal analysis vs. correlation fallacies
- Context gathering and enrichment
- Effective escalation protocols and handoffs

### Advanced Level:
- Automated triage systems and algorithms
- Machine learning for anomaly detection and pattern recognition
- Probabilistic reasoning in complex system failures
- Game day exercises and chaos engineering for triage readiness
- Continuous improvement of triage processes
- Quantitative measurement of triage effectiveness

## 3. Banking/Financial Services Context

### Specific Application Areas:
- Payment processing systems (retail, wholesale, and international)
- Trading platforms and order management systems
- Core banking transaction processing
- Digital banking channels (web, mobile, API)
- Fraud detection and prevention systems
- Regulatory reporting and compliance systems

### Industry-Specific Considerations:
- Regulatory requirements (PSD2, Basel III, GDPR)
- Financial impact measurement (revenue loss, compensation costs)
- Transaction integrity and reconciliation challenges
- 24/7 availability expectations for critical services
- Multi-tiered service architecture with complex dependencies
- Batch processing windows and real-time processing requirements
- Third-party integration points and API dependencies
- Customer impact assessment and prioritization

### Banking-Specific Challenges:
- Dual-write consistency issues in distributed financial systems
- Legacy system integration with modern cloud architecture
- Real-time vs. batch processing triage differences
- Peak load periods (month-end, tax season, holidays)
- Balancing security controls with rapid investigation needs
- Data sensitivity constraints during investigation
- Cross-border and multi-currency complications

This definition provides a solid foundation for developing our SRE training materials, focusing specifically on Integration & Triage skills for banking professionals transitioning from production support roles. The materials will systematically build knowledge from fundamental monitoring concepts to sophisticated triage strategies while maintaining banking-specific relevance.
