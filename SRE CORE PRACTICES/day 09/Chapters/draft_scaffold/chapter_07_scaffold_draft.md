# Chapter 7: Collaborative On-Call Practices

## Panel 1: Beyond the Hero Model - Shared Responsibility
### Scene Description

 In a dimly lit operations center at 2AM, we see Katherine, an exhausted on-call engineer, struggling alone with multiple alert screens. Her phone shows 17 unread messages, while dashboards display cascading failures across payment processing systems. In contrast, a second scene shows a modern SRE team in a virtual war room where four engineers collaborate on different aspects of the same incident—one analyzing logs, another communicating with stakeholders, a third running diagnostic tools, and a fourth coordinating the response. The contrast between isolation and collaboration is striking and deliberate.

### Teaching Narrative
The hero model of on-call—where a single engineer faces the chaos alone—creates unsustainable cognitive burden and limits incident response effectiveness. Collaborative on-call practices recognize that complex banking systems exceed any individual's comprehensive understanding. By distributing responsibilities across a team during incidents, we leverage diverse expertise, reduce response time, and create natural knowledge sharing opportunities. This collaborative approach ensures no single person becomes a critical point of failure and transforms incidents from individual burdens to team learning experiences. The transition from production support to SRE requires moving from "I need to solve this alone" to "We solve this together, with clear roles and responsibilities."

## Panel 2: Structured Knowledge Transfer - Documentation as Collaboration
### Scene Description

 The scene shows a split screen of two engineers handling the same critical trading platform incident. On the left, a new on-call engineer scrambles through outdated wikis, chat logs, and emails trying to find relevant information, while alerts continue to pile up. On the right, another engineer calmly follows a well-structured runbook with embedded troubleshooting decision trees, system diagrams, and historical incident references. The runbook includes clear escalation paths and "known unknowns" sections that identify system areas requiring expert consultation, with contact information for subject matter experts.

### Teaching Narrative
Effective on-call collaboration begins before incidents occur through structured knowledge documentation. In traditional production support, knowledge often remains trapped in individual experts' minds or scattered across disconnected sources, creating high-stakes scavenger hunts during incidents. SRE practices treat documentation as a collaborative artifact that continuously evolves. Living runbooks, service catalogs, and decision trees externalize tacit knowledge, making the combined wisdom of the team available to anyone responding to an incident. This documentation isn't static—it represents an ongoing conversation among engineers about how systems behave, what failure modes exist, and which resolution strategies work. Well-structured knowledge artifacts transform on-call from isolated troubleshooting to standing on the shoulders of the entire team's collective experience.

## Panel 3: Tiered Response Models - Right People, Right Time
### Scene Description

 An incident coordination dashboard shows a tier-based escalation in progress for a critical payment gateway failure. The visualization displays three concentric circles representing escalation tiers: Tier 1 (the initial responder assessing impact and scope), Tier 2 (domain experts for the affected systems now joining a video call), and Tier 3 (senior architects and business stakeholders being notified but not yet engaged). A timeline shows the incident progression with decision points for escalation. The screen includes role assignments updating in real-time as new responders join, with clear ownership indicators for different workstreams.

### Teaching Narrative
Effective collaborative on-call systems recognize that not every incident requires the same response magnitude or expertise profile. Tiered response models create structured escalation paths that bring in the right expertise at the right time, balancing comprehensive response against unnecessary disruption. Unlike traditional support models where escalation often means "passing the problem upward," SRE tiered responses are about assembling the optimal team composition based on incident characteristics. The model defines clear criteria for tier transitions, ensuring timely escalation without overreaction. This approach transforms on-call from binary individual accountability to a fluid team response that adapts to the incident's evolving nature. By establishing these frameworks in advance, we remove ambiguity about when to engage others and create predictable patterns that reduce coordination overhead during high-stress situations.

## Panel 4: Follow-the-Sun Models - Global Collaboration
### Scene Description

 A world map displays banking operations centers across multiple time zones, with arrows showing on-call handoffs following daylight. We see a split screen of three teams: Singapore operations completing their day and documenting ongoing issues, London team in mid-shift reviewing the handover notes while managing current incidents, and New York team beginning their day and receiving a live video briefing. A shared incident management dashboard shows consistent tracking across all regions, with annotations from each team building on previous observations. 

### Teaching Narrative
As banking systems become globally integrated, traditional regional on-call models create artificial boundaries that fragment incident response and institutional knowledge. Follow-the-sun collaboration models recognize that reliability is a 24/7 global responsibility where teams across time zones function as a single distributed entity rather than isolated shifts. This approach transforms handovers from brief summaries to rich knowledge transfers that maintain context and momentum. Critical to this model is the shared understanding that on-call responsibilities aren't simply "passed" between regions but collaboratively managed across a global team with continuous situational awareness. This requires standardized communication protocols, consistent tooling, and a unified incident taxonomy that transcends regional differences. For organizations transitioning from production support to SRE practices, follow-the-sun represents a fundamental shift from "my region, my responsibility" to "our global systems, our shared responsibility."

## Panel 5: On-Call Shadowing - Experiential Learning
### Scene Description

 Two engineers sit side by side at a workstation, with multiple monitoring screens showing a developing incident involving the bank's fraud detection system. The experienced engineer narrates her thought process out loud while navigating through dashboards, logs, and diagnostic tools. The shadowing engineer takes notes in a structured template with sections for symptoms, investigation approaches, tools used, and decision points. On a nearby whiteboard, we see a "shadow rotation schedule" showing all team members cycling through shadowing experiences with different senior engineers over the next month.

### Teaching Narrative
On-call expertise isn't developed through documentation alone—it requires guided experiential learning that traditional production support models rarely formalize. Structured shadowing programs pair experienced and newer engineers during real incidents, transforming tribal knowledge into explicit learning. Unlike passive observation, effective shadowing involves the experienced responder verbalizing their mental models and decision frameworks while the shadow actively questions and documents the process. This creates a cognitive apprenticeship where intuitive expertise becomes systematically transferable. For teams transitioning to SRE practices, implementing formal shadow rotations acknowledges that reliable incident response is a skill developed through deliberate practice, not just accumulated experience. This approach breaks down the common "sink-or-swim" mentality of traditional on-call onboarding while creating a continuous knowledge transfer mechanism that strengthens the entire team's capabilities.

## Panel 6: Psychological Safety in On-Call - Foundation for Collaboration
### Scene Description

 A team retrospective session focuses on a major incident that occurred the previous week. On a digital whiteboard, we see sections for "What Went Well," "What Could Improve," and "Action Items," with notes contributed by multiple team members. The manager is visibly engaged and pointing to an action item that reads "Update runbook with lessons from production incident." A junior engineer who was on-call during the incident is openly discussing a decision that extended the incident duration, without defensive body language. Other team members ask clarifying questions without blame language, focused on system improvements rather than individual critique.

### Teaching Narrative
Collaborative on-call cannot thrive without psychological safety—the shared belief that team members won't be punished or humiliated for speaking up with ideas, questions, concerns, or mistakes. In traditional production support environments, on-call incidents often become sources of blame and reputational risk, driving defensive behaviors and information hiding. SRE practices recognize that incidents represent valuable learning opportunities that require transparent sharing of what happened, including decisions that may have extended or complicated the response. This transparency depends on leadership that consistently demonstrates that incidents reflect system fragility, not individual failure. For teams transitioning to SRE, building psychological safety means deliberately changing how we speak about incidents—from "Who caused this?" to "What system conditions enabled this?" This cultural foundation transforms on-call from a high-stress individual burden to a supported team activity where learning outweighs blame.

## Panel 7: On-Call Engineering - Reducing Future Pain
### Scene Description

 An SRE team gathered around a "Toil Board" showing metrics from the past month's on-call incidents. The visualization displays categorized incidents by frequency, response time, and resolution complexity. Team members place sticky notes on specific incident types with automation ideas. A prioritization matrix on another whiteboard shows "High Pain, High Frequency" incidents at the top right, with engineering projects mapped to address them. A team calendar shows dedicated "toil reduction" time blocks allocated between on-call rotations. One engineer updates a dashboard with a "toil reduction progress" graph showing declining alerts in specific categories.

### Teaching Narrative
The most mature collaborative on-call practice is systematically eliminating the need for human intervention through continuous improvement. Traditional production support often accepts on-call pain as an inevitable cost of doing business, but SRE views frequent alerts as engineering problems to be solved. By instrumenting and analyzing on-call activities, patterns of toil become visible and addressable through automation, better detection mechanisms, and system redesign. This approach transforms on-call from a reactive stance to a proactive engineering discipline where each incident becomes data that drives system improvement. For teams transitioning to SRE, implementing structured "toil reduction" practices signals that the organization values both immediate incident response and the engineering work that prevents future incidents. The collaborative element emerges as teams collectively identify, prioritize, and address the highest-impact improvement opportunities, creating a virtuous cycle where on-call experiences directly shape engineering priorities.
