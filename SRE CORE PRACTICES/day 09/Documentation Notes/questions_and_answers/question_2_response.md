# Defining the SRE Topic and Application Domain for 'Culture & Reliability Engineering'

## 1. Scope and Boundaries of 'Culture & Reliability Engineering'

**Scope:**

- The integration of organizational culture principles with technical reliability practices
- How team dynamics, communication patterns, and shared values influence system reliability
- The transition from reactive incident response to proactive reliability planning
- Tools, processes, and mindsets required for effective reliability engineering
- Balancing technical excellence with human factors and organizational behaviors

**Boundaries:**

- Focus on cultural and organizational aspects that directly impact system reliability
- Exclude purely technical implementation details that don't connect to cultural elements
- Concentrate on the intersection of human decision-making and technical systems
- Include principles applicable across different technical stacks but exclude stack-specific implementations
- Cover incident management processes but not detailed disaster recovery procedures

## 2. Core Principles and Concepts to Cover

**Cultural Elements:**

- Blame-free post-incident analysis and psychological safety
- Shared responsibility and service ownership models
- Data-driven decision making over opinion-based approaches
- Transparent communication about system health and reliability goals
- Learning organization principles applied to technology operations
- Building a culture of experimentation and controlled risk-taking

**Reliability Engineering Elements:**

- Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and Error Budgets as management tools
- Observability vs. traditional monitoring approaches
- Proactive testing methodologies (chaos engineering, game days)
- Systematic incident response and blameless postmortems
- Reliability as a product feature rather than an afterthought
- Balancing feature velocity with system stability

**Transitional Concepts for Production Support Teams:**

- Moving from reactive alerting to proactive reliability planning
- Shifting from uptime-focused metrics to customer experience metrics
- Evolving from siloed responsibilities to cross-functional collaboration
- Transforming from manual intervention to automated resilience
- Changing from incident blame to systems thinking approaches

## 3. Banking/Financial Services Context

**Industry-Specific Application:**

- Trading platforms and payment processing systems requiring both speed and accuracy
- Core banking systems with 24/7 availability requirements and zero tolerance for data corruption
- Regulatory compliance requirements (SOX, PCI-DSS, GDPR, BASEL) affecting reliability practices
- Multi-regional deployment models to ensure business continuity
- Legacy systems integration with modern reliability practices

**Banking-Specific Challenges:**

- Balancing innovation with extremely high stability requirements
- Managing cost controls while ensuring redundancy and resilience
- Navigating change management in heavily regulated environments
- Coordinating reliability practices across vendor-supplied and in-house systems
- Translating technical reliability metrics into financial risk measures

**Banking Impact Focus Areas:**

- Direct correlation between system reliability and revenue/customer trust
- Regulatory and compliance implications of reliability failures
- Reputational damage from public-facing incidents
- Financial losses from trading platform downtime or payment processing errors
- Customer experience impact when core banking services are degraded

**Banking-Specific Implementation Contexts:**

- Digital banking platforms accessed by millions of customers
- Real-time fraud detection systems requiring both speed and accuracy
- High-volume transaction processing environments with strict consistency requirements
- Wealth management platforms with complex dependency chains
- ATM networks and card payment infrastructure with distributed reliability challenges

This foundation provides a clear scope for our 'Culture & Reliability Engineering' curriculum, identifies the core concepts we'll cover, and grounds them in specific banking contexts that will resonate with your target audience of production support professionals transitioning to SRE roles in financial services.
