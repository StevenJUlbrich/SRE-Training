## 2. Relevant Industry Regulations and Compliance Factors

**Key Regulatory Frameworks:**
- **Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS)** operational resilience principles
- **Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)** operational resilience requirements
- **Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX)** controls for financial reporting systems
- **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)** requirements for payment systems
- **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** and customer data considerations
- **Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC)** IT examination guidelines
- **Dodd-Frank Act** requirements for institutional stability
- **Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)** Technology Risk Management Guidelines
- **European Banking Authority (EBA)** Guidelines on ICT and security risk management

**Compliance Considerations for SRE:**
- Audit trails for automated changes to production systems
- Evidence collection for incident response effectiveness
- Documentation requirements for reliability testing activities
- Change management procedures that satisfy regulatory scrutiny
- Recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO) documentation
- Access controls and separation of duties in reliability practices
- Regulatory reporting requirements for significant operational incidents
- Third-party vendor reliability assessment and management

## 3. Critical Banking Systems for 'Culture & Reliability Engineering'

**High-Priority Systems:**
- **Payment Processing Platforms**: Card authorization, ACH, wire transfers
- **Core Banking Systems**: Account management, ledger, transaction processing
- **Trading Platforms**: Order management, execution, settlement
- **Digital Banking Channels**: Mobile apps, online banking portals
- **ATM Networks and Card Infrastructure**: Transaction processing, cash management
- **Fraud Detection and Prevention Systems**: Real-time monitoring and blocking
- **Wealth Management Platforms**: Portfolio management, trading, reporting
- **Loan Origination and Servicing Systems**: Application processing, document management
- **Interbank Settlement Systems**: Nostro/vostro account reconciliation
- **Regulatory Reporting Systems**: Financial and compliance reporting

**System Characteristics Requiring Advanced Reliability Practices:**
- High transaction volumes with strict latency requirements
- Zero tolerance for data corruption or loss
- Complex dependencies across multiple internal and external systems
- 24/7 availability expectations with minimal maintenance windows
- Strict regulatory requirements for operational resilience
- Hybrid infrastructure spanning legacy and modern technologies
- Global distribution with regional regulatory variations

## 4. Connecting to Banking Business Metrics and Outcomes

**Business Impact Metrics:**
- **Revenue Impact**: Transaction throughput, authorization approval rates, trade execution success
- **Cost Metrics**: Incident response costs, regulatory penalties, operational inefficiencies
- **Customer Experience**: Net Promoter Score, customer retention, mobile app ratings
- **Risk Measurements**: Operational risk exposure, potential financial losses from outages
- **Efficiency Metrics**: Mean time to recovery, change success rates, deployment frequency
- **Growth Enablement**: Speed of feature delivery, time-to-market for new products
- **Competitive Positioning**: Service availability compared to industry benchmarks

**Business Outcome Framing:**
- Frame reliability improvements in terms of customer trust and retention
- Connect system stability to regulatory compliance and reduced audit findings
- Translate technical metrics into financial impact using revenue-per-minute calculations
- Link reliability practices to the bank's ability to launch new products safely
- Demonstrate how SRE practices reduce operational costs through automation and incident reduction

## 5. Tailoring to Address Audience Analysis Concerns

**Addressing Knowledge Gaps:**
- Include "From Production Support to SRE" sidebars in each chapter that explicitly bridge the gap
- Provide more detailed explanations of statistical concepts like error budgets with financial analogies
- Include "Technical Deep Dive" sections that build distributed systems knowledge progressively
- Create explicit connections between familiar monitoring practices and modern observability approaches
- Develop supplementary learning paths for specific technical knowledge gaps

**Leveraging Existing Skills:**
- Begin chapters with familiar incident scenarios that production support would recognize
- Use their existing system knowledge as a foundation for introducing SRE concepts
- Draw parallels between current troubleshooting techniques and more proactive approaches
- Acknowledge and validate their current expertise before introducing new methodologies
- Create exercises that transform their existing documentation into SRE artifacts

**Supporting Mindset Shifts:**
- Include "Mindset Moment" reflections throughout chapters to highlight perspective changes
- Provide concrete examples of how specific SRE practices would have prevented familiar incidents
- Show progressive transformation stories rather than suggesting immediate radical change
- Include practical steps for gradually shifting from reactive to proactive approaches
- Feature testimonials from production support professionals who successfully transitioned to SRE roles

**Terminology and Example Adaptations:**
- Create a comprehensive glossary mapping production support terms to SRE terminology
- Use familiar banking systems and scenarios as the foundation for all examples
- Initially introduce SRE concepts using their existing vocabulary before introducing new terms
- Include visual concept maps showing relationships between familiar concepts and new SRE approaches
- Design exercises that gradually transform existing monitoring dashboards into SLO-based views

By implementing these banking-specific adaptations, we'll create a curriculum that resonates deeply with production support professionals in financial services while addressing their specific knowledge gaps, leveraging their existing expertise, supporting critical mindset shifts, and using familiar terminology and examples to make the material immediately applicable to their daily work.
