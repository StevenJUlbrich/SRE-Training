# Audience Analysis for 'Culture & Reliability Engineering' Curriculum

## 1. Knowledge Gaps for Production Support Professionals

**Technical Knowledge Gaps:**
- Limited understanding of proactive testing methodologies (chaos engineering, resilience testing)
- Unfamiliarity with modern observability tools beyond traditional monitoring dashboards
- Gaps in understanding statistical approaches to reliability measurement
- Limited exposure to service level objectives (SLOs) and error budget methodologies
- Minimal experience with reliability automation beyond basic runbooks
- Limited knowledge of distributed systems architecture and failure modes
- Gaps in understanding microservice reliability challenges versus monolithic systems

**Cultural Knowledge Gaps:**
- Unfamiliarity with blameless postmortem techniques and psychological safety concepts
- Limited exposure to product-oriented thinking about reliability
- Gaps in understanding the business value quantification of reliability work
- Limited experience with cross-functional collaboration models
- Unfamiliarity with data-driven decision making for reliability investments
- Limited understanding of how to influence technical decision-making beyond escalations
- Minimal exposure to risk management frameworks beyond incident response

## 2. Existing Skills to Leverage

**Technical Skills:**
- Deep knowledge of system behaviors during specific failure modes
- Strong troubleshooting abilities and pattern recognition
- Familiarity with monitoring tools and alert interpretation
- Comprehensive understanding of banking system interdependencies
- Experience with incident response and resolution
- Detailed knowledge of common failure patterns in banking systems
- Hands-on experience with the critical path of financial transactions

**Soft Skills:**
- Communication during high-pressure situations
- Stakeholder management during incidents
- Customer impact assessment expertise
- Documentation of technical issues and resolutions
- Collaboration within support team structures
- Prioritization capabilities during multiple concurrent incidents
- Experience navigating compliance and regulatory requirements

## 3. Necessary Mindset Shifts

**From Reactive to Proactive:**
- From "fixing what's broken" to "preventing breakage through design"
- From "responding to alerts" to "designing resilient systems that reduce alerts"
- From "uptime as the goal" to "customer experience as the goal"
- From "individual heroics" to "systematic team approaches"
- From "blame for failures" to "learning from failures"
- From "measuring work by tickets closed" to "measuring impact by incidents prevented"
- From "following escalation procedures" to "owning service reliability end-to-end"

**Operational Perspective Shifts:**
- From "production is someone else's code" to "shared ownership of production"
- From "change is risky" to "lack of change is risky"
- From "stability through rigidity" to "stability through adaptability"
- From "process prevents failures" to "learning prevents failures"
- From "reliability as cost" to "reliability as value"
- From "focusing on components" to "focusing on customer journeys"
- From "specialist expertise" to "generalist capabilities with deep expertise"

## 4. Terminology and Example Adjustments

**Terminology Approaches:**
- Connect new SRE terminology to familiar monitoring and support concepts
- Gradually introduce reliability terms with banking-specific context
- Create glossaries that map production support vocabulary to SRE vocabulary
- Use consistent terminology across chapters with banking-specific examples
- Introduce acronyms carefully with repeated explanations in early chapters
- Define technical concepts in terms of customer and business impact
- Use visual aids to illustrate abstract reliability concepts

**Example Adaptations:**
- Frame reliability examples within familiar banking incident scenarios
- Connect theoretical SRE concepts to daily production support activities
- Use real-world banking applications (payments, trading, core banking) in examples
- Reference familiar monitoring tools when introducing new observability concepts
- Show incident remediation scenarios that evolve from reactive to proactive approaches
- Illustrate cultural concepts through realistic team interactions in banking environments
- Demonstrate reliability improvements using metrics familiar to production support teams
- Incorporate compliance requirements into reliability examples for relevance
- Use actual banking dashboards and alerts as starting points for SRE transformations

**Learning Path Adjustments:**
- Begin with familiar incident response scenarios, then gradually introduce proactive approaches
- Connect new reliability concepts to existing production support procedures
- Start with small wins that production support can implement immediately
- Introduce more abstract concepts only after establishing practical foundations
- Provide more scaffolding around statistical and probability-based reliability concepts
- Demonstrate immediate applicability to current banking systems support
- Include transitional steps between current state and SRE best practices rather than suggesting sudden transformation

Based on this analysis, we should refine our chapter outline to ensure we're building on existing skills, directly addressing knowledge gaps, facilitating the necessary mindset shifts, and adapting terminology and examples to resonate with production support professionals in banking environments.
