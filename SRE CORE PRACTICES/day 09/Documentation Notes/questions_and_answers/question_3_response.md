# 'Culture & Reliability Engineering' Curriculum: Chapter Outline

## Chapter 1: Foundations of Reliability Culture

An introduction to the essential mindset shift from reactive troubleshooting to proactive reliability engineering. Explores how organizational culture directly impacts system reliability and introduces the core values of modern SRE practices within banking environments.

## Chapter 2: From Monitoring to Observability

Contrasts traditional monitoring approaches with observability principles, highlighting the limitations of dashboard-centric thinking. Examines how production support teams can evolve their metrics collection and analysis to gain deeper system insights while introducing the three pillars of observability (logs, metrics, and traces) in banking systems.

## Chapter 3: Defining Reliability Through the Customer Lens

Introduces service level indicators (SLIs) and objectives (SLOs) as tools for measuring what customers actually experience. Shows how to transform vague reliability goals into measurable targets and demonstrates how to select appropriate SLIs for different banking services from trading platforms to customer-facing applications.

## Chapter 4: Error Budgets as Cultural Tools

Explores how error budgets create a shared language between development and operations teams in banking organizations. Demonstrates how to calculate, implement and communicate error budgets while showing how they enable more objective decisions about feature velocity versus stability.

## Chapter 5: Building a Blameless Culture

Examines how blame undermines reliability efforts and introduces frameworks for blameless postmortems. Provides techniques for focusing on systemic factors rather than individual mistakes and shows how psychological safety creates an environment where reliability can flourish.

## Chapter 6: Service Ownership Models for Financial Systems

Introduces the concept of service ownership where teams take full responsibility for their service's reliability. Outlines how to transition from siloed support models to end-to-end ownership while addressing regulatory compliance requirements unique to financial institutions.

## Chapter 7: Reliability as a Product Feature

Reframes reliability from a cost center to a competitive advantage in banking services. Explores techniques for including reliability requirements in the definition of done and demonstrates how to communicate reliability improvements in terms of business value and customer trust.

## Chapter 8: Collaborative On-Call Practices

Provides frameworks for building sustainable on-call rotations that don't lead to burnout. Introduces techniques for knowledge sharing during incident response and shows how to gradually transition production support engineers to broader SRE responsibilities through structured on-call mentoring.

## Chapter 9: Resilience Testing in Banking Environments

Introduces controlled chaos engineering and game day exercises appropriate for financial services. Shows how to design safe experiments that reveal system weaknesses before they impact customers and covers special considerations for testing mission-critical banking infrastructure.

## Chapter 10: Automation as a Reliability Multiplier

Explores the culture shift from manual operations to reliability automation in financial systems. Covers the gradual transformation of runbooks to automated responses while addressing the unique compliance requirements and change control processes in banking environments.

## Chapter 11: Communication Patterns During Incidents

Examines effective communication strategies during high-pressure incident scenarios. Provides frameworks for status updates, coordination across teams, and customer communication while introducing techniques specifically designed for critical financial service disruptions.

## Chapter 12: Learning from Incidents

Explores how to transform incidents from crises into valuable learning opportunities. Shows how to conduct effective incident reviews that focus on systemic improvements rather than blame and demonstrates how to build a knowledge repository of lessons learned.

## Chapter 13: Measuring Cultural Evolution in Reliability

Introduces frameworks for measuring improvements in reliability culture beyond technical metrics. Shows how to track the maturity of SRE practices across teams and provides methods for demonstrating the business impact of cultural transformations to banking leadership.

## Chapter 14: Reliability and Regulatory Compliance

Addresses the intersection of SRE practices with financial regulatory requirements. Shows how well-designed reliability engineering actually enhances compliance and provides techniques for documenting reliability practices for auditors and regulators.

## Chapter 15: Building Learning Organizations

Explores how banking institutions can foster continuous improvement in reliability practices. Provides frameworks for cross-team learning, SRE communities of practice, and knowledge-sharing while showing how to institutionalize reliability culture beyond individual champions.

This outline provides a progressive learning journey from foundational concepts to advanced organizational practices, always connecting reliability engineering principles to the specific context of banking and financial services while addressing the needs of production support professionals transitioning to SRE roles.
