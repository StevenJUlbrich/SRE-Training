# SRE Training: Logs and Logging Systems for Banking Professionals

## Chapter Outline

### Chapter 1: From Monitoring to Observability - The Logging Evolution
Introduces the fundamental shift from traditional monitoring to modern observability, with logs as a cornerstone. Establishes the context for production support professionals by comparing familiar monitoring tools with modern logging approaches in banking systems.

### Chapter 2: Log Anatomy - Building Blocks of Effective Logging
Examines the structure and components of well-designed log entries, focusing on what makes logs useful for troubleshooting. Bridges production support experience by demonstrating how proper log structure accelerates incident resolution in transaction processing systems.

### Chapter 3: The Logging Hierarchy - Beyond ERROR and INFO
Explores proper use of logging levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL) and their strategic implementation across banking applications. Challenges common production support misconceptions about log verbosity versus quality through payment processing examples.

### Chapter 4: Structured Logging - Bringing Order to Chaos
Contrasts unstructured logging with structured approaches (JSON, key-value pairs) and their impact on analysis capabilities. Shows how structured logging transforms troubleshooting workflows for banking professionals dealing with complex transaction flows.

### Chapter 5: Contextual Intelligence - Correlation IDs and Transaction Tracing
Focuses on including critical context in logs through transaction IDs, session identifiers, and request metadata. Demonstrates how proper context transforms fragmented troubleshooting into cohesive narratives when investigating customer authentication issues.

### Chapter 6: Centralized Logging Architecture - From Silos to Systems
Examines modern centralized logging architectures, collection methods, and aggregation strategies. Bridges the gap between traditional server-by-server log analysis and holistic system views needed for distributed banking platforms.

### Chapter 7: Log-Based Alerting - From Reactive to Proactive
Explores how logs drive intelligent alerting and early warning systems in critical banking services. Shifts the production support mindset from responding to incidents to anticipating and preventing them through log pattern recognition.

### Chapter 8: Log Sampling and Filtering - Managing Volume Without Losing Insight
Addresses techniques for dealing with high-volume logs in transaction-intensive environments. Introduces statistical sampling, intelligent filtering, and dynamic verbosity to maintain visibility while controlling storage and processing costs.

### Chapter 9: Compliance and Retention - Meeting Banking Regulatory Requirements
Covers log lifecycle management with emphasis on regulatory compliance (SOX, PCI-DSS, GDPR). Connects familiar audit requirements to modern immutable logging techniques that satisfy both operational and compliance needs.

### Chapter 10: Troubleshooting with Logs - The SRE Methodology
Presents systematic approaches to log-based investigation using real banking scenarios. Transforms the production support "search and hope" approach into structured SRE methodologies for rapid root cause analysis.

### Chapter 11: Logs and Error Budgets - Quantifying Reliability
Introduces the concept of error budgets and how logging practices affect SLI/SLO measurements. Helps production support professionals shift from binary "up/down" thinking to nuanced reliability measurement through log-derived indicators.

### Chapter 12: Distributed Systems Logging - Following the Thread
Explores techniques for tracing requests across distributed banking services through log correlation. Bridges the gap between traditional monolithic logging and the challenges of microservice architectures in modern banking platforms.

### Chapter 13: Log-Driven Development - Building Observability from the Start
Introduces the practice of designing systems with effective logging as a core requirement rather than an afterthought. Shows how production engineers can advocate for improved logging during development cycles of new banking features.

### Chapter 14: Machine Learning for Log Analysis - Finding the Needle in the Haystack
Explores advanced techniques for pattern detection, anomaly identification, and predictive analysis using logs. Demonstrates how AI-assisted log analysis transforms fraud detection capabilities and transaction monitoring.

### Chapter 15: Observability Pipelines - The Future of Banking Logs
Examines cutting-edge approaches to log transformation, enrichment, and streaming analytics in banking environments. Provides a vision of the SRE's role in building comprehensive observability systems that integrate logs with metrics and traces.

This outline creates a progressive learning journey from fundamental logging concepts to advanced observability practices, specifically tailored for banking professionals making the transition from production support to SRE roles.
