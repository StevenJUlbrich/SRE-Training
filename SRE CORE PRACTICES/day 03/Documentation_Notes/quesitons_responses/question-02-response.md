# SRE Topic and Application Domain Definition: Logs and Logging Systems

## 1. Scope and Boundaries of Logs and Logging Systems

### Core Scope
The training will focus on logs as a fundamental pillar of observability in modern banking systems, covering:

- Log generation, collection, processing, storage, and analysis
- Evolution from traditional logging to modern logging systems
- The relationship between logs and other observability signals (metrics and traces)
- Log-based troubleshooting methodologies and practices
- Log management at scale in distributed banking systems

### Boundaries
To maintain focus, we'll explicitly exclude:

- Deep dives into specific logging tool implementations (though examples will be used)
- Extensive coverage of metrics and tracing (addressed only where they intersect with logging)
- Data lake architecture beyond what's needed for log storage and analysis
- Security information and event management (SIEM) - touched upon but not deeply explored

## 2. Core Principles and Concepts to Cover

### Fundamental Concepts
1. **Log Anatomy**: Structure, formats, and components of effective log entries
2. **Logging Levels**: Proper use of DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL in banking contexts
3. **Structured vs. Unstructured Logging**: The shift toward structured logging and its advantages
4. **Contextual Logging**: Including transaction IDs, correlation IDs, and request context
5. **Centralized Logging**: Collection and aggregation strategies

### SRE-Specific Concepts
6. **Log-Based Alerting**: From reactive to proactive incident detection
7. **Log Sampling and Filtering**: Dealing with high-volume logs in critical systems
8. **Log Lifecycle Management**: Retention, archiving, and compliance requirements
9. **Error Budget Impact**: How logging practices affect reliability measurements
10. **Log Driven Development**: Designing systems with effective logging from the start

### Advanced Topics
11. **Distributed Tracing Integration**: Connecting logs across service boundaries
12. **Machine Learning for Log Analysis**: Pattern detection and anomaly identification
13. **Real-time Log Analytics**: Stream processing for immediate insights
14. **Observability Pipelines**: Modern approaches to log transformation and routing
15. **Chaos Engineering for Logging**: Testing logging system resilience

## 3. Banking/Financial Services Context

### Industry-Specific Applications
1. **Transaction Processing Systems**: Logging in high-throughput payment platforms
2. **Trading Platforms**: Time-sensitive logging in market-connected systems
3. **Fraud Detection Systems**: Log patterns that indicate suspicious activity
4. **Customer Authentication Flows**: Logging sensitive information securely
5. **Mobile/Online Banking Interfaces**: Client-side to server-side log correlation

### Regulatory and Compliance Context
6. **Audit Trail Requirements**: Meeting regulatory log retention mandates (SOX, PCI-DSS)
7. **GDPR and Data Privacy**: Managing personally identifiable information in logs
8. **Non-repudiation**: Immutable logging for transaction verification
9. **Forensic Analysis**: Log-based investigation of security incidents
10. **Regulatory Reporting**: Using logs to generate compliance evidence

### Banking-Specific Challenges
11. **High-Volume Transaction Environments**: Managing log verbosity without losing fidelity
12. **24/7 Operation Requirements**: Log rotation and management without downtime
13. **Multi-Region/Multi-Country Operations**: Geographically distributed logging
14. **Legacy System Integration**: Connecting mainframe and modern system logs
15. **Batch Processing Visibility**: Logging for overnight batch jobs and reconciliation processes

This foundation provides a clear direction for our SRE training materials on Logs and Logging Systems, tailored specifically for banking professionals transitioning from production support roles. Each concept will be explored through the hybrid graphic novel approach outlined in your framework.
