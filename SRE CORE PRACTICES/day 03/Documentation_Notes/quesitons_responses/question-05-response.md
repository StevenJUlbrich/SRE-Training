- **Banking Example**: Following a single wire transfer through multiple systems (customer portal, fraud check, compliance screening, correspondent banking, settlement) using correlation IDs.
- **Real Scenario**: Investigating intermittent authentication failures in mobile banking by tracing user sessions across frontend, authentication services, and backend systems.

### Chapter 6: Centralized Logging Architecture - From Silos to Systems
- **Banking Example**: Consolidating logs from branch systems, ATM networks, online banking, and backend processing into a unified view.
- **Real Scenario**: Diagnosing cross-channel inconsistencies where a transaction appears in mobile banking but not in the branch teller system.

### Chapter 7: Log-Based Alerting - From Reactive to Proactive
- **Banking Example**: Setting up alerts based on patterns that indicate potential fraud (unusual account access patterns, rapid sequential withdrawals).
- **Real Scenario**: Detecting early warning signs of an imminent trading system capacity issue by monitoring log patterns during market opening.

### Chapter 8: Log Sampling and Filtering - Managing Volume Without Losing Insight
- **Banking Example**: Implementing intelligent sampling for high-volume credit card processing during Black Friday shopping periods.
- **Real Scenario**: Managing massive log volumes during quarter-end financial close processes while maintaining auditability.

### Chapter 9: Compliance and Retention - Meeting Banking Regulatory Requirements
- **Banking Example**: Designing immutable log storage for high-value wealth management transactions with 7-year retention policies.
- **Real Scenario**: Preparing for regulatory audit by extracting evidence of proper controls from historical transaction logs.

### Chapter 10: Troubleshooting with Logs - The SRE Methodology
- **Banking Example**: Systematic investigation of a failed ACH batch process using logs to identify transaction rejection patterns.
- **Real Scenario**: War room scenario during a payment processing incident where properly structured logs lead to faster resolution.

### Chapter 11: Logs and Error Budgets - Quantifying Reliability
- **Banking Example**: Establishing SLOs for investment platform order execution based on log-derived latency measurements.
- **Real Scenario**: Using log analysis to determine if a financial data feed meets contractual reliability requirements.

### Chapter 12: Distributed Systems Logging - Following the Thread
- **Banking Example**: Tracing a mortgage application through origination, underwriting, approval, and funding services.
- **Real Scenario**: Diagnosing data inconsistencies in distributed ledger systems using correlated logs.

### Chapter 13: Log-Driven Development - Building Observability from the Start
- **Banking Example**: Designing robust logging requirements for a new mobile payment feature.
- **Real Scenario**: Collaborating with developers to improve logging in an investment portfolio management system.

### Chapter 14: Machine Learning for Log Analysis - Finding the Needle in the Haystack
- **Banking Example**: Using ML to identify patterns in authentication logs that indicate credential stuffing attacks.
- **Real Scenario**: Automated analysis of trading system logs to identify performance anomalies during market volatility events.

### Chapter 15: Observability Pipelines - The Future of Banking Logs
- **Banking Example**: Building real-time fraud detection pipelines that combine transaction logs with customer behavior data.
- **Real Scenario**: Implementing streaming log analytics for continuous monitoring of payment systems.

## 2. Industry Regulations and Compliance Factors
