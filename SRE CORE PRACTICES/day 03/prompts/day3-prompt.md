Structure the content with tiered guidance for different experience levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced/SRE) and include practical examples, code implementations, and detailed case studies that illustrate both successes and challenges in operationalizing SRE practices.

Your training should emphasize a "brick-by-brick" approach to establishing mature SRE practices, with particular focus on the practical implementation of SLIs, SLOs, error budgets, and incident management processes. Include YouTube video placeholders and hands-on exercises that reinforce key concepts.

Most importantly, write in the voice of an experienced SRE leader - practical, strategic, and focused on both technical excellence and organizational transformation. Create material that genuinely helps professionals establish and evolve SRE practices in their organizations.
