# Chapter 7: Remediation Strategies and Decision-Making

## Panel 1: The Remediation Crossroads
### Scene Description

 A tense war room where a diverse team of banking SREs and application owners stare at a large digital decision tree projected on the wall. The tree shows multiple paths: "Rollback," "Forward Fix," and "Workaround." A payment processing dashboard shows a growing queue of failed transactions as a large clock on the wall shows 10:34 AM, with markers indicating the incident has been ongoing for 47 minutes. The incident commander, a woman with a determined expression, points to the decision tree while team members look anxious but focused.

### Teaching Narrative
When facing a critical banking incident, the remediation approach you choose can significantly impact both recovery time and business consequences. Many production support professionals transitioning to SRE roles struggle with this pivotal moment, often defaulting to the most familiar solution rather than the most appropriate one. The Remediation Decision Framework provides a structured approach to selecting between three primary options: rollbacks (reverting to a known good state), forward fixes (deploying new code to address the issue), or workarounds (implementing temporary solutions that restore service without addressing the root cause). This decision isn't merely technical—it requires balancing recovery speed, risk of further disruption, customer impact, and regulatory implications. The most experienced SREs know that sometimes the fastest technical fix isn't the safest choice for a financial institution, and the safest option may come with unacceptable business delays. This panel introduces the systematic evaluation approach that transforms reactive "best guess" remediation into evidence-based decision making.

## Panel 2: Rollback Precision Engineering
### Scene Description

 In a monitoring center, an SRE is executing a carefully orchestrated rollback process. Multiple screens show database transaction states, in-flight payments, and deployment pipelines. The SRE's hands hover over a keyboard with a large "EXECUTE ROLLBACK" button displayed on the center screen. A whiteboard visible in the background shows a detailed checklist titled "Trading Platform Rollback Protocol" with items like "Transaction Boundary Identification," "Data Consistency Verification," and "Coordinated Component Sequencing." Other team members are on phones, coordinating the rollback sequence across multiple systems.

### Teaching Narrative
Rollbacks in financial systems aren't simple "undo" operations—they're precisely engineered processes that must maintain data integrity and transaction consistency. Traditional support approaches often view rollbacks as emergency actions with acceptable collateral damage, but in SRE practice, rollbacks are designed as clean operations that preserve system state integrity. This panel explores the concept of "transactional boundaries" in banking systems, where the complexity isn't just in reverting code but in understanding and preserving the state of in-flight financial transactions. We'll examine how effective rollbacks require comprehensive knowledge of system dependencies, transaction lifecycles, and state management. The SRE approach transforms rollbacks from risky last resorts into precise, well-rehearsed recovery mechanisms that can be executed with confidence even in high-stakes financial environments.

## Panel 3: The Forward Fix Validation Pipeline
### Scene Description

 A split-screen visual shows two SREs working in parallel. On one side, a developer rapidly codes a fix for a critical authentication service issue while automated tests run in a separate window. On the other side, another SRE is setting up a sophisticated staging environment that replicates production traffic patterns with synthetic transactions representing various banking operations. Between them is a shared dashboard showing the current system degradation—customers unable to access their accounts—with a counter of affected users steadily increasing. A workflow diagram on the wall shows an accelerated validation pipeline with stages labeled "Development," "Automated Testing," "Load Testing," "Canary Deployment," and "Progressive Rollout."

### Teaching Narrative
When time is critical and a rollback isn't viable, forward fixes provide the path to resolution—but they come with significant risk in banking environments. The traditional approach of "fix fast, fix twice" is unacceptable when handling financial data. This panel introduces the concept of the "Accelerated Validation Pipeline," which maintains rigorous quality controls while dramatically compressing the timeframe for deploying critical fixes. Unlike standard deployments that might take days or weeks to move through testing cycles, incident-driven forward fixes require specialized pipelines that parallel-process validation steps without compromising essential safeguards. We explore how SREs balance the urgency of restoration with the discipline of proper testing, especially when financial transactions are at stake. This approach transforms high-pressure coding from a dangerous necessity into a controlled, methodical process that maintains appropriate guardrails even under extreme time constraints.

## Panel 4: Blast Radius Containment
### Scene Description

 An SRE team is working on a large, touch-enabled transparent display showing a banking system topology map with interconnected services. One section glows red, indicating the area of the incident (a core transaction processing service). Team members are using gestures to draw containment boundaries around the affected area, with simulations showing how different containment strategies would impact customer-facing services. One simulation shows reduced functionality for wealth management clients but preserves core banking operations. Another shows all services operating but at degraded performance levels. A decision matrix on a nearby screen weighs factors like "customers affected," "transaction types impacted," and "regulatory reporting implications."

### Teaching Narrative
When full remediation requires extended time, containing the impact becomes the critical first step in managing a banking incident. The concept of "blast radius containment" is a foundational SRE practice that focuses on limiting damage rather than immediately pursuing complete resolution. Traditional support approaches often attempt to fix everything simultaneously, but effective SREs recognize the value of isolation strategies that allow unaffected systems to continue normal operation. This panel explores containment patterns including service degradation (maintaining core functionality while disabling non-essential features), traffic shaping (redirecting users to alternate systems), and capacity reallocation (redistributing resources to prioritize critical functions). We'll examine how these decisions require deep understanding of both technical dependencies and business priorities—which transaction types are most critical to maintain, which customer segments must be prioritized based on regulatory requirements, and which operational compromises are acceptable during incident resolution.

## Panel 5: The Decision Authority Matrix
### Scene Description

 A banking executive is rushing into the incident command center where the SRE team is mid-response to a major incident affecting the bank's international wire transfer system. On the wall, a clearly defined "Decision Authority Matrix" shows different decision types (rollback, customer communication, feature disablement, etc.) mapped to roles rather than individuals. The executive points to a specific cell in the matrix showing that the decision to disable a specific payment feature temporarily falls to the Incident Commander, not executive management. The Incident Commander, a calm SRE with a headset, is explaining the technical rationale for the decision while the executive listens attentively, visibly transitioning from concern to understanding.

### Teaching Narrative
In high-pressure remediation scenarios, clear decision authority prevents delays and confusion that could extend outages. Traditional organizational hierarchies often break down during incidents, with unclear escalation paths and approval requirements creating costly delays. The SRE approach establishes predefined decision frameworks that assign authority based on incident type, impact level, and remediation category—not just organizational title. This panel introduces the concept of "delegated authority" in incident response, where senior leadership explicitly transfers certain decision-making powers to technical responders for specific scenarios. We explore how this matrix balances the need for rapid technical decisions with appropriate governance oversight, especially in regulated financial environments. By establishing these boundaries in advance, organizations transform crisis decision-making from an ad-hoc, personality-driven process into a structured framework that enables faster recovery while maintaining appropriate controls.

## Panel 6: The Time-Impact Curve
### Scene Description

 A war room where an SRE team is debating remediation options for a degraded trading platform. The central display shows a graph labeled "Time-Impact Curve" with three different remediation scenarios plotted. Each line shows how customer impact (y-axis) would change over time (x-axis) under different approaches. One line shows a rapid drop with a risk marker; another shows a slower but steadier decline. Team members point to different parts of the curves, with speech bubbles indicating discussions about "acceptable impact duration," "risk tolerance," and "recovery certainty." On a side screen, actual trading volume data shows the real-time financial impact of the ongoing issue.

### Teaching Narrative
Not all remediation approaches are created equal, and selecting between options requires understanding both the time dimension and the impact profile of each strategy. This panel introduces the "Time-Impact Curve" concept, which visualizes how different remediation approaches affect service recovery over time. Traditional incident response often fixates exclusively on total resolution time without considering the shape of the recovery curve. The SRE approach examines not just when full resolution occurs, but how impact diminishes throughout the remediation process. Some approaches offer immediate partial improvement followed by gradual recovery, while others maintain the current impact level until a complete fix enables full restoration. We explore how financial services require special consideration of "impact tolerance thresholds"—points beyond which regulatory reporting, financial losses, or reputational damage become severe. This analysis transforms remediation selection from a one-dimensional time estimate into a sophisticated modeling exercise that accounts for the full customer experience throughout the recovery journey.

## Panel 7: Learning from Remediation Choices
### Scene Description

 A post-incident review meeting where the team is analyzing the effectiveness of their remediation decision. On a split screen, we see what actually happened versus what alternative approaches would have yielded. A decision tree shows the path taken highlighted in green, with abandoned options in gray. Data visualizations show actual recovery time, customer impact metrics, and financial consequences. Team members are engaged in thoughtful discussion, with notes being taken for future playbooks. On a board titled "Remediation Decision Repository," similar incidents from the past are categorized with their resolution approaches and outcomes, creating a knowledge base of effective strategies.

### Teaching Narrative
Each remediation decision is an opportunity to build organizational wisdom about effective resolution strategies. This panel explores how experienced SREs transform isolated incident decisions into systematic learning that improves future response. The concept of the "Remediation Decision Repository" moves beyond traditional "lessons learned" documents to create structured, searchable knowledge about which approaches work best for specific incident types. Unlike siloed post-mortems that focus only on what went wrong, this repository captures both successful and unsuccessful remediation attempts, creating pattern recognition that informs faster, more effective future decisions. We examine how effective remediation learning requires capturing not just what was done, but why specific options were selected or rejected, including the constraints and priorities that drove the decision. This systematic approach transforms incident remediation from isolated emergency response into a continuous learning cycle that incrementally improves the organization's ability to effectively resolve future incidents.
