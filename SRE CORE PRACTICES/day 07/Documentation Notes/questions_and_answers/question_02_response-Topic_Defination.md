# Defining Incident Response for Banking SRE Training Materials

Let me help define the scope, core principles, and banking context for your Incident Response SRE training materials following Steps 1 and 2 of your methodology.

## 1. Scope and Boundaries of Incident Response

### Scope Definition
Incident Response in the SRE context covers the structured approach to identifying, investigating, containing, resolving, and learning from service disruptions that impact system reliability and customer experience.

### Boundaries
- **Includes**: Detection systems, alert classification, investigation techniques, remediation procedures, post-incident analysis, and continuous improvement
- **Excludes**: Detailed infrastructure setup, comprehensive security incident response (except where it overlaps with reliability), and enterprise-wide disaster recovery planning

### Focus Areas
- Transition from reactive monitoring/alerting to proactive incident management
- Structured incident management processes with defined roles and workflows
- Decision-making frameworks during service disruptions
- Systematic post-incident learning and prevention

## 2. Core Principles and Concepts to Cover

### Fundamental Concepts
- **Incident Definition and Classification**: Severity levels, impact assessment, escalation criteria
- **Alert Design**: Signal vs. noise, actionable alerts, reducing alert fatigue
- **First Response Protocols**: Initial triage, communication channels, data gathering
- **Investigation Methodology**: Systematic troubleshooting, evidence-based diagnosis, correlation analysis

### Intermediate Concepts
- **Incident Command Structure**: Incident commander role, clear responsibilities during incidents
- **Effective Communication**: Status updates, stakeholder management, technical and non-technical communication
- **Remediation Strategies**: Safe rollbacks, forward fixes, traffic shifting, circuit breakers
- **Service Level Objectives (SLOs)**: Measuring reliability, error budgets, impact quantification

### Advanced Concepts
- **Blameless Postmortems**: Structured analysis, focus on systems not individuals, action item tracking
- **Chaos Engineering**: Proactively testing failure scenarios, building system resilience
- **Incident Response Automation**: Runbooks, automated remediation, self-healing systems
- **Learning Culture**: Converting incidents into organizational knowledge, continuous improvement

## 3. Banking/Financial Services Context

### Industry-Specific Considerations
- **Regulatory Requirements**: Compliance with financial regulations (Basel III, PSD2, SOX)
- **Transaction Criticality**: High-value, time-sensitive transactions requiring immediate resolution
- **Multi-channel Impact**: Branch, online, mobile, ATM, and payment network considerations
- **Data Integrity**: Ensuring no financial data loss or corruption during incidents

### Banking Applications
- **Payment Processing Systems**: Card transactions, ACH/wire transfers, real-time payments
- **Trading Platforms**: Order management, execution, settlement systems
- **Core Banking Systems**: Account management, ledger operations, interest calculations
- **Digital Banking Channels**: Mobile apps, online banking portals, API gateways
- **Fraud Detection Systems**: Real-time transaction monitoring and prevention

### Financial Impact Factors
- **Transaction Revenue Loss**: Direct financial impact from failed transactions
- **Regulatory Penalties**: Compliance violations resulting from prolonged outages
- **Customer Compensation**: Refunds and goodwill payments for affected customers
- **Reputational Damage**: Loss of customer trust affecting long-term relationships
- **Opportunity Cost**: Resources diverted from development to incident handling

This foundation provides clear direction for developing your incident response training materials, ensuring they're technically comprehensive while being directly applicable to banking professionals transitioning from production support to SRE roles.
