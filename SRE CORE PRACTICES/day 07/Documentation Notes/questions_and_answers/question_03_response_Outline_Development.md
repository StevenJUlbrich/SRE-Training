# SRE Incident Response Training: Chapter Outline

## Chapter 1: From Monitoring to Incident Response
**Description**: Explores the fundamental shift in mindset from traditional monitoring to proactive incident response. Contrasts the reactive approach of checking systems when alerts fire versus the comprehensive incident management lifecycle. Introduces key terminology and frameworks that distinguish SRE incident response from conventional production support.

## Chapter 2: The Anatomy of Banking Incidents
**Description**: Dissects the structure of typical banking incidents across payment, trading, and core banking systems. Establishes a classification framework for incident severity that aligns with both technical impact and business consequences. Introduces banking-specific concerns such as transaction integrity, financial reconciliation, and regulatory reporting requirements.

## Chapter 3: Alert Design and Initial Response
**Description**: Addresses how to design meaningful alerts that drive action rather than creating noise. Covers first responder protocols including initial triage, validation techniques, and evidence gathering. Emphasizes the critical transition from "Is there a problem?" to "What is the nature of the problem?" with practical banking examples.

## Chapter 4: Structured Investigation Methodologies
**Description**: Presents systematic troubleshooting approaches that replace ad-hoc investigation. Introduces scientific method application to incident investigation, including hypothesis formation and validation. Demonstrates how to effectively use logs, metrics, and traces to establish causality rather than correlation in complex financial systems.

## Chapter 5: Incident Command and Coordination
**Description**: Establishes the incident command structure and role definitions needed for effective incident management. Covers coordination techniques for cross-functional teams spanning application, infrastructure, and business domains. Addresses the unique challenges of managing incidents that span multiple banking channels or have upstream/downstream dependencies.

## Chapter 6: Communication During Banking Incidents
**Description**: Focuses on effective stakeholder communication during incidents affecting financial services. Provides frameworks for clear status updates to technical and non-technical audiences including executives, regulators, and customers. Addresses the balance between transparency and accuracy when communicating about financial impact.

## Chapter 7: Remediation Strategies and Decision-Making
**Description**: Explores tactical and strategic approaches to incident resolution in high-stakes banking environments. Presents decision frameworks for choosing between rollbacks, forward fixes, or workarounds based on business impact. Introduces the concept of "blast radius" containment to minimize financial and customer impact during remediation.

## Chapter 8: Blameless Postmortems and Continuous Learning
**Description**: Transforms the traditional "root cause analysis" into a systemic learning opportunity through blameless postmortems. Provides a structured approach to incident retrospectives that focuses on improvement rather than blame. Demonstrates how to convert lessons learned into actionable improvements for banking systems.

## Chapter 9: SLOs and Error Budgets in Financial Services
**Description**: Connects incident response to the broader reliability framework through Service Level Objectives. Introduces error budgets as a quantitative approach to balancing innovation and stability in banking platforms. Shows how to develop appropriate SLOs for different financial services that reflect true customer experience.

## Chapter 10: Building Resilient Banking Systems
**Description**: Culminates with advanced approaches to proactively prevent incidents through resilience engineering. Introduces chaos engineering practices adapted for the financial services environment. Addresses how to gradually transform reactive incident management into a proactive resilience culture while maintaining the stability expected in banking operations.

This outline provides a logical progression from fundamental incident response concepts to advanced resilience practices, specifically tailored for banking professionals transitioning from production support to SRE roles. Each chapter builds upon previous knowledge while introducing new concepts that gradually shift mindset and practices toward the SRE approach to incident management.
