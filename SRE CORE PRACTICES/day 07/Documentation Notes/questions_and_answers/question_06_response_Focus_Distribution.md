### Practical Application Focus
- **Decision Frameworks**: Less technical depth, more practical application for decision-making
- **Communication Approaches**: Highly practical with minimal technical complexity
- **Team Coordination**: Focus on practical implementation rather than theory
- **Implementation Steps**: Concrete, actionable guidance over technical explanation

### Chapter-by-Chapter Technical Balance

| 10: Building Resilient Banking Systems           | High            | High                  |

### Technical Progression Strategy
- Begin each chapter with accessible concepts before introducing technical depth
- Use visual illustrations to support understanding of complex technical concepts
- Provide progressive technical challenges throughout the course
- Include optional "deep dive" sections for technically-inclined readers

## 4. Balancing Theoretical Concepts with Concrete Examples

### Theoretical vs. Practical Balance
- **Theoretical Framework Introduction**: Brief theoretical introduction (20-25% of content)
- **Banking Example Application**: Concrete banking example (30-35% of content)
- **Hands-On Exercises**: Practical application opportunities (25-30% of content)
- **Implementation Guidance**: Actionable steps for real-world use (15-20% of content)

### Example Integration Strategies
- **Example First Approach**: Lead with a concrete banking example before introducing theory
- **Theory-Example Pairing**: Present theoretical concept immediately followed by banking application
- **Progressive Example Complexity**: Use simple examples for new concepts, complex examples for familiar ones
- **Multi-System Examples**: Demonstrate concept application across different banking systems

### Banking Examples from Domain Adaptation
- **Payment Flows**: Payment gateway timeouts, credit card processing, transaction reconciliation
- **Banking Channels**: Mobile authentication, ATM networks, branch teller systems
- **Trading Systems**: Order processing, market data, settlement systems
- **Regulatory Reporting**: Compliance failures, disclosure requirements, evidence preservation
- **Data Integrity**: Customer data synchronization, financial reconciliation, transaction validation

### Example Distribution Framework
- **Early Chapters**: More basic examples (e.g., payment gateway timeouts, digital banking login)
- **Middle Chapters**: Intermediate complexity (e.g., inter-bank settlement, third-party disruptions)
- **Later Chapters**: Advanced scenarios (e.g., multi-region infrastructure, chaos engineering)
- **Character-Based Examples**: Use recurring characters facing increasingly complex scenarios

## Implementation Strategy for Maintaining Balance

### Content Creation Guidelines
1. **Begin with SRE Core**: Draft core SRE content first, ensuring comprehensive coverage
2. **Banking Context Layer**: Add banking context as a secondary layer, keeping to 15% limit
3. **Technical Depth Scale**: Rate each section on technical depth (1-5) and adjust as needed
4. **Example Integration Check**: Ensure every theoretical concept has at least one concrete example
5. **Panel Structure Adherence**: Follow standardized panel structure with prescribed focus percentages

### Review Process
1. **85/15 Audit**: Review each chapter for adherence to 85/15 content distribution
2. **Technical Depth Assessment**: Evaluate technical content appropriateness for audience
3. **Example Relevance Check**: Verify all banking examples align with domain-specific adaptation
4. **Practical Application Validation**: Ensure actionable guidance for each concept
5. **Terminology Balance**: Confirm appropriate balance of SRE and banking terminology

### Specific Balance Adjustments Based on Domain Adaptation
- **Regulatory Context**: Keep regulatory content brief (5-8% maximum) and focused on incident implications
- **System-Specific Details**: Limit detailed system descriptions to necessary context only
- **Banking Metrics**: Integrate banking business metrics primarily in impact sections
- **Technical Tool References**: Balance between SRE tools and familiar banking monitoring systems
- **Banking Terminology**: Use precise banking terms but explain them briefly where needed

By following these guidelines, we'll maintain the proper 85/15 balance between core SRE incident response concepts and banking-specific context, while ensuring appropriate technical depth and concrete examples throughout the training materials.
