# Audience Analysis for Incident Response SRE Training

## 1. Knowledge Gaps for Production Support Professionals

### Technical Knowledge Gaps
- **Systems Thinking**: Limited experience viewing incidents as system failures rather than isolated component issues
- **Failure Modes Engineering**: Unfamiliarity with designing for failure and predicting potential failure scenarios
- **Statistical Analysis**: Gap in using quantitative approaches to measure reliability and set thresholds
- **Service Architecture Understanding**: Often know individual components deeply but lack end-to-end service flow knowledge

### Process Knowledge Gaps
- **Structured Incident Command**: Limited exposure to formal incident management structures with defined roles
- **Blameless Culture Practices**: May come from environments where incidents focus on "who" rather than "why"
- **Hypothesis-Driven Investigation**: Tendency to jump to solutions before fully understanding problems
- **Automation Approach**: Gap in programmatically addressing repetitive incident response tasks

### Strategic Knowledge Gaps
- **Business Impact Assessment**: Difficulty translating technical failures into business impact metrics
- **Risk Management**: Limited experience with error budgets and risk-based prioritization
- **Continuous Improvement Frameworks**: Unfamiliarity with structured improvement cycles beyond basic fixes
- **Stakeholder Management**: Gap in effectively communicating with business and executive stakeholders

## 2. Existing Skills to Leverage

### Technical Skills
- **System-Specific Expertise**: Deep knowledge of specific banking systems and their common failure modes
- **Troubleshooting Experience**: Strong diagnostic skills developed through extensive troubleshooting
- **Alert Response Workflows**: Well-practiced response to monitoring systems and alerts
- **Banking Domain Knowledge**: Understanding of banking terminology and operational requirements

### Process Skills
- **Procedure Execution**: Experience following defined operational procedures and runbooks
- **Change Management**: Familiarity with banking change control processes and requirements
- **Documentation Practices**: Experience maintaining and using operational documentation
- **Shift Handover Protocols**: Skills in communicating status across team shifts

### Soft Skills
- **Working Under Pressure**: Experience handling high-stress situations affecting banking operations
- **Operational Resilience**: Ability to maintain focus during extended incident resolution
- **Technical Communication**: Skills explaining technical issues to other technical team members
- **Customer Impact Awareness**: Understanding of how system issues directly affect banking customers

## 3. Necessary Mindset Shifts

### From Reactive to Proactive
- **Symptom Focus → Root Cause Analysis**: Shift from addressing immediate symptoms to understanding underlying causes
- **"Fix Now" → "Fix Forever"**: Moving from quick fixes to permanent solutions that prevent recurrence
- **Component Thinking → Service Thinking**: Transition from component-level to service-level reliability
- **Scheduled Maintenance → Continuous Improvement**: Shifting from periodic fixes to ongoing enhancement

### From Individual to System
- **Human Error → System Design**: Reframing "mistakes" as system design opportunities
- **Hero Culture → Team Resilience**: Moving from celebrating individual heroes to building team capabilities
- **Siloed Responsibility → Shared Ownership**: Transitioning from "not my problem" to shared service ownership
- **Blame Assignment → Learning Opportunity**: Seeing incidents as chances to improve rather than assign fault

### From Process to Outcome
- **Checklist Completion → Customer Experience**: Focusing on customer outcomes rather than completing procedures
- **Metric Watching → Service Delivery**: Shifting from watching dashboards to ensuring service delivery
- **Activity Measurement → Impact Measurement**: Moving from tracking activities to measuring business impact
- **Time to Resolution → Time to Detection**: Emphasizing early detection over faster fixing

## 4. Terminology and Example Adjustments

### Terminology Bridges
- Introduce SRE terms alongside familiar production support equivalents:
  - "Incident Command" ↔ "Major Incident Management"
  - "Service Level Objectives" ↔ "Availability Targets"
  - "Error Budgets" ↔ "Acceptable Downtime"
  - "Post-Incident Analysis" ↔ "Root Cause Analysis"

### Example Adjustments
- **Start with Familiar Systems**: Base initial examples on systems they already support (payment gateways, core banking)
- **Progressive Complexity**: Begin with straightforward incidents before introducing complex, multi-system scenarios
- **Tool Continuity**: Reference existing monitoring tools (e.g., ITRS Geneos) while introducing SRE approaches
- **Regulatory Context**: Frame examples within banking regulatory requirements they already understand

### Practical Application Focus
- **Day-One Value**: Emphasize techniques they can immediately apply in their current roles
- **Incremental Adoption**: Present SRE practices as evolutionary rather than revolutionary
- **Quick Win Scenarios**: Include examples with visible short-term benefits to build confidence
- **Role Transformation Stories**: Incorporate narratives of production support professionals who successfully transitioned to SRE

### Banking-Specific Adaptation
- **Transaction-Centric Examples**: Focus on payment processing and financial transaction reliability
- **Reconciliation Challenges**: Include scenarios involving financial reconciliation and data integrity
- **Multi-Channel Impact**: Present incidents that span digital, branch, and ATM banking channels
- **Compliance Implications**: Integrate regulatory reporting and compliance considerations into examples

Based on this analysis, we should update our chapter outline to specifically address these knowledge gaps, leverage existing skills, facilitate mindset shifts, and use appropriate terminology and examples for banking production support professionals.
