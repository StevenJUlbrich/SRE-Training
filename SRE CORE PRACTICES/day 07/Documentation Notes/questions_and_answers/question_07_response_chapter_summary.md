# Final Chapter List for SRE Incident Response Training

1. **From Monitoring to Incident Response**  
   Establishes the fundamental mindset shift from traditional monitoring to proactive incident response in banking systems. Contrasts reactive dashboard watching with holistic service health management. Introduces key SRE principles that form the foundation for effective incident handling.

2. **The Anatomy of Banking Incidents**  
   Provides a comprehensive framework for classifying and understanding incidents in financial services. Examines the structure of payment, trading, and core banking incidents through an SRE lens. Establishes a shared vocabulary for incident severity that aligns technical impact with business consequences.

3. **Alert Design and Initial Response**  
   Transforms alerting from noisy interruptions to meaningful, actionable signals that drive appropriate response. Covers first responder protocols that leverage banking domain knowledge while introducing structured SRE approaches. Emphasizes the critical transition from alert acknowledgment to effective initial triage.

4. **Structured Investigation Methodologies**  
   Introduces systematic, evidence-based troubleshooting that replaces ad-hoc investigation in complex financial systems. Presents scientific method application to incident investigation, including hypothesis formation and validation. Demonstrates effective use of logs, metrics, and traces to establish causality in banking transaction flows.

5. **Incident Command and Coordination**  
   Establishes formal incident command structure with clearly defined roles adapted for financial services contexts. Covers coordination techniques for cross-functional teams spanning application, infrastructure, and business domains. Addresses the unique challenges of managing incidents that impact multiple banking channels or services.

6. **Communication During Banking Incidents**  
   Provides frameworks for clear, timely, and appropriate stakeholder communication during financial service disruptions. Balances transparency with accuracy when communicating about incidents with regulatory or financial impact. Addresses communication needs across technical teams, executives, regulators, and customers.

7. **Remediation Strategies and Decision-Making**  
   Explores tactical and strategic approaches to incident resolution in high-stakes banking environments. Presents decision frameworks for choosing between rollbacks, forward fixes, or workarounds based on business impact. Introduces the concept of "blast radius" containment to minimize financial and customer impact during remediation.

8. **Blameless Postmortems and Continuous Learning**  
   Transforms traditional "root cause analysis" into systemic learning opportunities through blameless postmortems. Provides a structured approach to incident retrospectives that focuses on improvement rather than blame. Demonstrates how to convert lessons learned into actionable improvements for banking systems.

9. **SLOs and Error Budgets in Financial Services**  
   Connects incident response to broader reliability objectives through Service Level Objectives tailored for financial services. Introduces error budgets as a quantitative approach to balancing innovation and stability in banking platforms. Shows how to develop appropriate SLOs for different financial services that reflect true customer experience.

10. **Building Resilient Banking Systems**  
    Culminates with advanced approaches to proactively prevent incidents through resilience engineering practices. Introduces chaos engineering adapted for financial services regulatory constraints. Addresses how to transform reactive incident management into a proactive resilience culture while maintaining the stability expected in banking operations.
