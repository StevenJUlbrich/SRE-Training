# Initial Approach for SRE Training Material Development

## Starting the Conversation

Begin with a clear, structured prompt that establishes:

1. **Purpose and Goal**: "I need help creating comprehensive SRE training materials for professionals transitioning from production support to Site Reliability Engineer roles in [specific domain, e.g., banking/fintech]."

2. **Framework Explanation**: "Let's use a structured approach with chapters focused on [specific SRE topic], following a consistent format that includes practical examples, banking-specific applications, and implementation guidance."

3. **Template Specification**: "Each chapter should follow this format:
   - Panel title with visual scene description
   - Teaching narrative explaining core concepts
   - Common real-world problem example
   - SRE best practice with evidence-based investigation
   - Business impact in banking/financial context
   - Implementation guidance with practical steps"

4. **Content Distribution**: "Maintain approximately 85% focus on core SRE topics with 15% on supporting narrative elements and domain-specific applications."

## Collaborative Process

After establishing the framework, proceed with:

1. **Topic Selection**: "Let's start by defining our SRE topic focus. I'm thinking about [metrics/incident response/etc.]. Do you think this is appropriate for our audience?"

2. **Chapter Outline**: "Based on this topic, could you suggest a logical progression of chapters from fundamentals to advanced concepts? I'm looking for about 10-15 chapters."

3. **Chapter Scaffold**: "For Chapter 1 on [topic], could you create a scaffold showing the panel titles, scene descriptions, and teaching narratives we'll need to develop?"

4. **Content Development**: "Now, let's develop the full content for Chapter 1, focusing on practical banking examples and clear implementation guidance."

## Feedback Loop

Establish a clear review and refinement process:

1. "After you generate each chapter, I'll review it for technical accuracy and alignment with our goals."

2. "If revisions are needed, I'll provide specific feedback on which elements need adjustment."

3. "Once a chapter is finalized, we'll move to the next one, applying any lessons learned."

This structured approach ensures both you and the AI have a shared understanding of the process, format, and goals, even without prior conversation history. The explicit framework gives the AI clear parameters to work within, while the collaborative process allows for adjustments as you progress.

Would you like me to refine any aspect of this approach based on your specific needs?
