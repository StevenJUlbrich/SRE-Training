SRE Core Curriculum: A Hybrid Graphic Novel Approach

Project Vision
The Metric Curriculum is an innovative educational initiative that transforms complex Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) concepts into an engaging hybrid graphic novel format. This curriculum aims to bridge the gap between traditional IT operations monitoring (like ITRS Geneos) and modern metric practices for production support professionals in the banking industry.
Core Project Goals

Transform Technical Learning: Replace dry, abstract technical documentation with narrative-driven, visually engaging content that makes metric concepts memorable and applicable.
Banking Industry Focus: Ground all examples, scenarios, and case studies in real banking system impacts to ensure immediate practical relevance for financial sector professionals.
Character-Driven Education: Utilize a diverse cast of characters with different backgrounds and technical proficiencies to represent various learning perspectives and challenges in adopting metric practices.
Progressive Skill Building: Structure content in three distinct tiers (Foundations, Intermediate, Advanced) to guide learners from basic monitoring concepts to sophisticated metric strategies.
Visual Reinforcement: Employ carefully crafted panel sequences and consistent visual language to illustrate technical concepts, system behaviors, and problem-solving approaches.

Format Innovation
This curriculum pioneers a hybrid approach that combines:

Narrative Teaching: Conversational, story-driven explanations of technical concepts
Visual Panels: Sequential art depicting real-world scenarios and technical visualizations
Technical Depth: Substantial prose sections with banking-specific examples and practical applications
Character Development: Consistent characterization of Hector and supporting cast to create emotional investment in the learning journey

Target Outcomes
The curriculum aims to transform how banking professionals approach system reliability by:

Building a deep understanding of the differences between monitoring and metric
Developing practical skills in interpreting logs, metrics, and traces
Creating a mental framework for identifying and addressing system reliability issues proactively
Establishing a shared vocabulary and approach to metric across technical teams

This hybrid format combines the depth of written instruction with the visual engagement of graphic novels to create a uniquely effective educational experience for technical professionals in the banking sector.
