[TOPIC] 101+ Curriculum: A Hybrid Graphic Novel Approach

Project Vision
The [TOPIC] Curriculum is an innovative educational initiative that transforms complex Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) concepts into an engaging hybrid graphic novel format. This curriculum aims to bridge the gap between traditional IT operations monitoring (like ITRS Geneos) and modern [TOPIC] practices for production support professionals in the banking industry.
Core Project Goals

Transform Technical Learning: Replace dry, abstract technical documentation with narrative-driven, visually engaging content that makes [TOPIC] concepts memorable and applicable.
Banking Industry Focus: Ground all examples, scenarios, and case studies in real banking system impacts to ensure immediate practical relevance for financial sector professionals.
Character-Driven Education: Utilize a diverse cast of characters with different backgrounds and technical proficiencies to represent various learning perspectives and challenges in adopting [TOPIC] practices.
Progressive Skill Building: Structure content in three distinct tiers (Foundations, Intermediate, Advanced) to guide learners from basic monitoring concepts to sophisticated [TOPIC] strategies.
Visual Reinforcement: Employ carefully crafted panel sequences and consistent visual language to illustrate technical concepts, system behaviors, and problem-solving approaches.

Format Innovation
This curriculum pioneers a hybrid approach that combines:

Narrative Teaching: Conversational, story-driven explanations of technical concepts
Visual Panels: Sequential art depicting real-world scenarios and technical visualizations
Technical Depth: Substantial prose sections with banking-specific examples and practical applications
Character Development: Consistent characterization of Hector Alavaz and supporting cast to create emotional investment in the learning journey

Target Outcomes
The curriculum aims to transform how banking professionals approach system reliability by:

Building a deep understanding of the differences between monitoring and [TOPIC]
Developing practical skills in interpreting logs, [TOPIC]s, and traces
Creating a mental framework for identifying and addressing system reliability issues proactively
Establishing a shared vocabulary and approach to [TOPIC] across technical teams

This hybrid format combines the depth of written instruction with the visual engagement of graphic novels to create a uniquely effective educational experience for technical professionals in the banking sector.

### Example Based On Observability  

Panel 1: The Pager Screams - Understanding the Green Wall Fallacy
Teaching Narrative
When the pager wakes you at 02:57 AM, your first instinct is to trust your dashboards. This is a dangerous impulse that experienced SREs must overcome.
In this critical scenario, Katherine made a fundamental mistake that production support professionals transitioning to SRE roles often make: trusting dashboard colors over evidence. When his monitoring systems showed green while users reported failures, he hesitated and questioned the alert rather than the dashboard.
The Green Wall Fallacy Explained
The Green Wall Fallacy is a common observability anti-pattern where monitoring systems display a "wall of green" tiles suggesting everything is functioning normally, while critical services are actually failing. This happens because:

Misaligned Measurement Focus: The dashboard is monitoring secondary indicators (CPU, memory) rather than primary service outcomes (successful transactions).
Replica vs. Primary Blindness: The systems are only measuring health signals from replicas or read paths, completely missing failures in primary write paths.
Lag in Signal Propagation: The dashboards may report historical or cached data that hasn't updated to reflect current reality.

Katherine's reflexive thought ("Maybe the alert's false... the graph is green") demonstrates a monitoring mindset rather than an observability mindset. In monitoring, we trust the dashboard. In observability, we trust the evidence.
SRE Best Practice: Evidence-Based Investigation
Notice that Katherine ultimately does the right thing by testing the actual endpoint with a curl command, which reveals the truth immediately: HTTP 500. This direct testing approach should be your first response, not your last resort.
Banking Impact
In financial systems, this fallacy is particularly dangerous. While dashboards glow green, real money transfers are failing, ATMs are rejecting withdrawals, and customer trust is eroding by the second. The regulatory and financial impact grows exponentially with each minute of misdiagnosis.
Implementation Guidance:
To avoid the Green Wall Fallacy in your environment:

Ensure dashboards include direct customer impact [TOPIC]s (success rates, error counts)
Monitor both primary and replica systems separately
Test actual user paths programmatically with synthetic transactions
Never trust a dashboard that contradicts customer reports
