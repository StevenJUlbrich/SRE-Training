For Days 2 and 3, I would recommend focusing on the following aspects to create a complete training program:
Day 2 (Metrics & Logs Implementation) could cover:

Reference Architectures in Detail

Deeper dive into how Google, Netflix, and other tech leaders implement observability
Architectural patterns for different scales of organization
Case studies of observability evolution at major companies


Advanced Metrics Implementation

Building standardized metrics libraries
RED (Rate, Errors, Duration) and USE (Utilization, Saturation, Errors) methods in practice
SLI/SLO implementation with metrics
Dimensional vs. hierarchical metrics debate


Advanced Logging Practices

Log aggregation at scale
Handling PII and sensitive data in logs
Log rotation, retention, and archiving strategies
Setting up centralized logging infrastructure


Dashboard Design Principles

Information hierarchy in observability dashboards
Effective alert thresholds and visualization
Building dashboards for different audiences (developers vs. management)
User experience considerations in dashboard design



Day 3 (Tracing & Integration) could focus on:

Distributed Tracing at Scale

Sampling strategies for high-volume production
Implementing context propagation across service boundaries
Trace visualization best practices
Integrating with service meshes (Istio, Linkerd)


Anti-Patterns and Pitfalls

Common observability anti-patterns
Cost management for observability data
Addressing alert fatigue
Handling observability in legacy systems


Integrated Observability Platforms

Evaluating commercial observability solutions
Building vs. buying observability tooling
Migration strategies between observability systems
Multi-environment observability challenges


Observability-Driven Development

Designing for observability from the start
Testing observability instrumentation
CI/CD integration for observability code
Creating observability development standards



What I think would enhance the material further would be:

More Interactive Exercises: While the current material includes exercise outlines, expanding these with actual hands-on labs, perhaps with downloadable code and infrastructure-as-code examples, would make the training more engaging.
Assessment Methods: Adding quizzes, knowledge checks, or small projects at the end of each day would help reinforce learning.
Cultural Aspects: Including sections on building an observability culture within organizations, addressing challenges in adoption, and involving different teams in the observability lifecycle.

Overall, the generated material provides an excellent foundation. With Days 2 and 3 covering these additional topics, you would have a comprehensive observability training program that addresses both technical implementation details and the broader SRE practices around observability.
