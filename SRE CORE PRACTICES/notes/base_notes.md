I want to generate a prompt to generate the material for day 1 based on the day-01-sre-core-v1.md and the recommendations you stated.  I have tried to gather them below.

Please review and ask questions for clarification if necessary on the prompt Generation.

Day 1: Observability Fundamentals

Add more explicit definition of the "Observe, Test, Evaluate, Act" framework

Include a Python example showing basic instrumentation

Add more concrete examples of unknown unknowns

Please improve Day [1 of the SRE Core Training Curriculum titled "Day 1 — Intro to Observability & SRE" featuring [CHARACTER]. Use the following structure:

1. Character Introduction (brief, establish personality and expertise)

Hector, The Veteran SRE (a.k.a. The Oracle)

Region: Mexico City

Style: War-torn, sarcastic, lives by logs and rituals. Carries a tarot deck of “system failures.”

Teaches: Foundations, mental models, resilience engineering

Voice: “This isn’t broken. It’s shy. Let’s coax it out with a histogram.”

2. Real-World Incident Hook (compelling story that demonstrates why this topic matters)

3. Learning Objectives (clearly tiered for Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced/SRE)

4. Core Concepts:

   - Clear definitions with visual analogies

   - Mermaid diagrams for key concepts

   - Explicit ties to the "3 Pillars of Observability" framework

   - Connection to Golden Signals and SLIs where relevant

5. Python Implementation Examples:

   - Provide practical code snippets showing implementation

   - Include comments explaining SRE best practices

   - Show both basic and advanced implementations

6. Hands-On Exercise:

   - Include specific example data

   - Provide clear success criteria

   - Include a "solution path" showing how to approach the problem

7. Dashboard & Visualization Examples:

   - Include mockups or descriptions of effective dashboards

   - Explain what signals matter and why

   - Show correlation between metrics, logs, and traces

8. Common Pitfalls & Anti-Patterns:

   - Specific examples of mistakes

   - How to recognize them

   - How to fix or avoid them

9. [CHARACTER]'s Commandments (memorable rules/principles)

10. Key Takeaways and Handoff to Next Day

Use a warm, engaging tone while maintaining technical accuracy. Focus on [PRIMARY SYSTEM/TOOL] as the anchor technology for this day, but mention how concepts apply across tools. Ensure all diagrams use Mermaid syntax. Integrate the concept of "Observe, Test, Evaluate, Act" methodology throughout.

11. Tiered Learning Objectives (🔍 Beginner, 🧩 Intermediate, 💡 Advanced/SRE) 

12.  Use **Mermaid diagrams** to illustrate:  
>    - All `sequenceDiagram` blocks must include `autonumber`  
>    - Use `&commat;` in place of `@` in any email addresses  
>    - Use <br> to replace \n
