## üñºÔ∏è Dashboard & Diagram Plans

Let‚Äôs be real: **no SRE training is complete without hot, sexy dashboards** and elegant diagrams. Here‚Äôs how to generate them:

### Diagram Types (use Mermaid.js or image prompts)
- **Flowcharts**: Incident Response Flow, Log Pipeline
- **Pyramids**: SLI ‚Üí SLO ‚Üí SLA
- **Timelines**: Tracing spans, Burn rate over time
- **Dashboards**:
  - Golden Signals Overview
  - SLO Compliance + Error Budget Tracker
  - Alert Drilldown: Metric ‚Üí Logs ‚Üí Trace

### Sample Dashboard Prompts (for image gen)
- ‚ÄúGrafana dashboard showing API latency, request rate, and 5xx error rate as line graphs with annotations‚Äù
- ‚ÄúBurn rate visualization with current SLO consumption over time and projected budget depletion‚Äù
- ‚ÄúCorrelated observability dashboard: log stream with trace IDs, metrics panel with RED method graphs, and Jaeger waterfall‚Äù

Want me to generate one now? I can make it pretty. Even your executives will pretend they understand it.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls Strategy

Explicitly mark a **section in each day** as:
```markdown
### üï≥Ô∏è Common Pitfalls:
- Mistake #1
- Mistake #2
- Mistake #3
```

Optionally pair with character snark:
> ‚ÄúMarisol once added `user_id` as a Prometheus label. We still talk about it. Don‚Äôt be Marisol.‚Äù

‚Äî

## TL;DR

You‚Äôre not building a slide deck. You‚Äôre building a multi-region, character-driven, tech-stack-inclusive curriculum that teaches SRE concepts through **narrative, diagrams, dashboards, incidents, and layered abstraction**.

Now it's ready to support:
- Golden signals as teaching pillars
- SLIs ‚Üí SLOs ‚Üí SLAs as a recurring narrative arc
- Dashboards and diagrams that are **functional, not just decoration**
- Pitfalls that *feel real*, not textbook

Want me to create:
- A template file for a daily module?
- Actual dashboard diagrams?
- Character templates?

Let me know which brick you want to lay next. You‚Äôve got mortar. I‚Äôve got memes.

## üõ† THE FIX: **‚ÄúOne Concept, One Anchor System‚Äù Rule**

Here‚Äôs how you tame the sprawl:

### 1. **Each day gets one *primary* system lens.**
You can *mention* others, but don‚Äôt teach through them.

Example:
- **Metrics Day (Day 2)** uses **Prometheus + K8s** as the anchor.
- You *mention* how it could look in Datadog or Geneos‚Äîbut don‚Äôt diagram it.
- You *compare* briefly to how a legacy VM would emit stats, but your dashboard mock comes from Prometheus.

> Think of it like a language. You speak Prometheus that day. You can quote others. But Prometheus is your main dialect.

---

### 2. **Characters Explain Why They Chose Their System**
Let the fictional engineers provide context:

> ‚ÄúI‚Äôm using OpenSearch because this cluster sits on RHEL9 VMs in a locked-down datacenter. Believe me, I‚Äôd love some cloud-native elasticity, but here we live and die by disk throughput.‚Äù

This builds narrative **and** keeps learners from thinking, *‚ÄúWait, should we be using OpenSearch too?‚Äù* They learn that the *concept* is transferable, even if the system is situational.

---

### 3. **Create a Consistent Visual Legend**
Show one static **‚ÄúTech Landscape Map‚Äù** early in the training that includes:
- All systems used
- Where they show up (Day X)
- Why (thematically relevant)

This reduces disorientation. It‚Äôs like giving them a mini "game map" so they don‚Äôt feel lost when the training jumps between stacks.

---

### 4. **Avoid Tool-Stack Stack Overflow**
Any time you feel the impulse to add *another tool* to make a point, ask:
- Can this concept be explained with one we‚Äôve already introduced?
- Is this **essential**, or am I showing off my observability cookbook?

If it‚Äôs not adding clarity, it‚Äôs adding noise. If you want to make it a bonus module or optional deep-dive, great. But don't jam 12 tools into 10 days unless your secret goal is SRE attrition.

---

### üëÄ TL;DR ‚Äì You‚Äôre Right, and Here‚Äôs the Path Forward

| Rule                                          | Why It Helps                            |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **1. Anchor each day to one core system**     | Prevents whiplash                       |
| **2. Use characters to justify tech choices** | Adds realism, avoids confusion          |
| **3. Show an overall tool map early**         | Learners know where they are            |
| **4. Don‚Äôt teach 12 tools when 3 will do**    | Simplifies attention = better retention |

---
Finally. Enough with the charming maps and emotional SRE avatars‚Äîlet‚Äôs dig into the **hard stuff**: the actual bones of your **SRE Core Training Curriculum**, brick by godforsaken brick.

We‚Äôre talking about the **real content engine**: concepts, incidents, dashboards, diagrams, and pitfalls that don‚Äôt make you feel like you‚Äôre on a guided meditation with a tracing agent.

## üìã TEMPLATE: DAILY MODULE STRUCTURE (Hard Mode Edition)

Let‚Äôs nail this down so every day hits like an engineer‚Äôs emotional support ticket.

```
### 1. Character Introduction
> Name, Role, Region, Personality Flavor  
> Timezone and system context they operate in  
> Why *they* care about today‚Äôs lesson

---

### 2. Real-World Scenario (Hook)
> An incident, outage, or silent failure  
> Stakes = data loss, money, time, career damage  
> Ends with: ‚ÄúHow could we have seen this coming?‚Äù

---

### 3. Learning Objectives (Tiered)
- üîç Beginner: __
- üß© Intermediate: __
- üí° Advanced: __

---

### 4. Core Concepts
- Explanation
- Visualized (diagram or dashboard)
- System-specific anchoring (w/ tool setup or flow)
- Analogies, examples, SRE tie-ins
- Common misconceptions

---

### 5. Troubleshooting Flow
> Incident Replay  
> Logs + Metrics + Traces ‚Üí Root cause  
> Diagram if it helps show the chain

---

### 6. Performance & Architecture Insight
> Tied to system evolution, scaling, cost  
> Redesigns, tuning examples

---

### 7. Tools, Practices, Monitors
- What to implement
- How to visualize it
- What to *watch for* when it breaks

---

### 8. Character's ‚ÄúCommandments‚Äù
> 3 hard-earned rules or memes  
> Style = personal, scarred, and quotable

---

### 9. Handoff to Next Day
> What was learned, what‚Äôs next  
> Context set by character (‚ÄúTomorrow you meet my friend in Nairobi. She hates dashboards.‚Äù)
```

---
Now *that* sounds like a training system built by someone who‚Äôs tired of superficial onboarding and ready to take people **all the way down the stack**‚Äîand maybe a little sideways too.

Yes. I‚Äôm not just okay with this‚ÄîI‚Äôm thrilled you want to build a **curriculum with character**, technical nuance, and *actual scaffolding* across all learner levels. Plus, you're using Kroki? That‚Äôs the observability equivalent of showing up to a knife fight with a diagrammable tank.

---

## ‚úÖ LET‚ÄôS ALIGN ON YOUR REQUEST

You're asking for a three-part curriculum framework:

### 1. **Create a cast of training personalities**  
> Veteran? Mystic? Specialist? Newbie? Done.  
Each character adds voice, cultural lens, and **teaching style**. That gives your modules humanity.

### 2. **Create a detailed curriculum by day**  
> 10-day plan, with each day having a clear technical theme.  
This includes objectives, concepts, and a progression path.

### 3. **Design for Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced tiers**  
> Because nobody wants to sit through an ‚Äúintro to logs‚Äù lecture when they‚Äôve been tracing microservice nightmares since 2017.

### 4. **Use Mermaid for diagrams**  

---

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è STEP 1: CHARACTER ROSTER ‚Äî YOUR TECHNICAL GUIDES

Let‚Äôs define 4 distinct ‚Äúmentors‚Äù you can reuse across modules or assign to themed days.

### üîπ **1. Hector Alavaz, The Veteran SRE (a.k.a. The Oracle)**
- **Region:** Mexico City
- **Style:** War-torn, sarcastic, lives by logs and rituals. Carries a tarot deck of ‚Äúsystem failures.‚Äù
- **Teaches:** Foundations, mental models, resilience engineering
- **Voice:** ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt broken. It‚Äôs *shy*. Let‚Äôs coax it out with a histogram.‚Äù

### üîπ **2. Asha, The Structured Beginner**
- **Region:** Nairobi
- **Style:** Curious, disciplined, asks excellent dumb questions (the best kind)
- **Teaches:** Helps learners connect, recap, question assumptions
- **Voice:** ‚ÄúOkay, but *why* would you use RED instead of USE?‚Äù

### üîπ **3. Felix, The Precision Engineer**
- **Region:** Berlin
- **Style:** Sharp, metric-obsessed, hates guesswork
- **Teaches:** Metrics, alert tuning, PromQL wizardry
- **Voice:** ‚ÄúEvery alert is either too early, too late, or wrong. Let‚Äôs fix that.‚Äù

### üîπ **4. Mina, The Chaos Whisperer**
- **Region:** Seoul
- **Style:** Calm during outages, performance-centric, traces systems like a forensic analyst
- **Teaches:** Distributed tracing, incident response, postmortems
- **Voice:** ‚ÄúThe system is talking to us. The trace is its confession.‚Äù

---

## üìã PER-DAY STRUCTURE (All 3 Skill Levels)

Every day will include:

- **Intro by character**
- **Hook/incident**
- **Tiered learning objectives**
- **Explanations (Beginner ‚Üí Advanced)**
- **Diagrams (Mermaid/PlantUML/Excalidraw format)**
- **Exercises (hands-on optional, analysis-first)**
- **Pitfalls**
- **Character‚Äôs commandments**

We‚Äôll write the content in Markdown with embedded diagrams in code blocks like:

### Mermaid Example:
```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A[SLI] --> B[SLO]
  B --> C[SLA]
  B --> D[Error Budget]
```
