# Content Balance Strategy for SLI/SLO/Error Budget Training

## 1. Maintaining 85% Focus on Core SRE Concepts

To ensure our content maintains the appropriate 85% focus on core SRE concepts related to SLIs, SLOs, and Error Budgets, I'll implement the following approach:

### Primary Focus Distribution
- **Foundational Concepts (Chapters 1-4)**: 80% core SRE principles of observability and SLIs, 20% banking context
- **Core SLO/Error Budget Concepts (Chapters 5-8)**: 90% technical SRE content, 10% banking application
- **Implementation Techniques (Chapters 9-10)**: 85% technical methodology, 15% banking-specific implementation challenges
- **Business Connection (Chapters 11-12)**: 75% SRE metrics-to-business framework, 25% financial services business metrics
- **Operational Application (Chapters 13-15)**: 80% SRE operational practices, 20% banking operational realities

### Section-Level Balance
Within each chapter panel, I'll maintain focus by structuring content as:
- **Teaching Narrative**: 100% core SRE concept explanation
- **Common Example**: 50% SRE concept, 50% banking application
- **SRE Best Practice**: 90% core SRE methodology, 10% banking adaptations
- **Banking Impact**: 30% general reliability impact, 70% banking-specific consequence
- **Implementation Guidance**: 70% universal SRE implementation, 30% banking-specific considerations

## 2. Integrating 15% Banking-Specific Applications

To effectively incorporate the 15% banking context while keeping it supportive rather than dominant:

### Integration Approaches
- **Scenario Framing**: Begin chapters with brief banking scenarios that illustrate the reliability challenge
- **Extended Examples**: Use consistent banking examples throughout chapters (e.g., payment processing reliability)
- **Regulatory Sidebars**: Include brief sidebars connecting SRE concepts to relevant regulations
- **Visual Banking Context**: Use banking-specific imagery in scene descriptions
- **Character Experiences**: Develop characters with banking technology backgrounds facing reliability challenges

### Context Distribution
- **Explicit Banking Sections**: Dedicate the "Banking Impact" section in each panel exclusively to industry relevance
- **Implicit Integration**: Weave banking terminology naturally throughout technical explanations
- **Implementation Challenges**: Address banking-specific implementation challenges in the final section of each panel
- **Regulatory Connections**: Make targeted connections to banking regulations where directly relevant to reliability concepts

## 3. Technical Depth vs. Practical Application Adjustments

Based on our audience analysis, I recommend these adjustments to balance technical depth with practical application:

### Early Chapters (1-5)
- **Reduce** theoretical mathematical foundations of reliability engineering
- **Increase** practical examples showing the transition from familiar monitoring to SLIs
- **Add** more comparative examples of traditional banking alerts versus SLO-based approaches
- **Maintain** technical accuracy while using more familiar terminology and visualization

### Middle Chapters (6-10)
- **Simplify** statistical concepts around error budget burn rates and multi-dimensional SLOs
- **Expand** practical implementation guidance with step-by-step approaches
- **Include** more banking-specific calculation examples
- **Connect** advanced concepts to familiar banking risk management frameworks

### Advanced Chapters (11-15)
- **Preserve** technical sophistication around maturity models and advanced reliability
- **Enhance** with concrete banking case studies showing practical application
- **Add** operational frameworks for implementing concepts within banking constraints
- **Provide** translation guides between SRE terminology and banking operations terminology

## 4. Balancing Theory and Concrete Examples

Drawing from the Domain Adaptation document, I'll implement these approaches to balance theoretical concepts with concrete banking examples:

### Theoretical Content Enhancements
- **Visual Concept Models**: Create visual representations of theoretical concepts using banking-specific imagery
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Introduce theoretical concepts gradually, starting with simple applications
- **Familiar Analogies**: Use banking risk management and compliance as analogies for reliability concepts
- **Conceptual Bridges**: Explicitly connect new SRE theories to familiar banking operational concepts

### Concrete Examples Implementation
- **Tiered Examples**: For each concept, provide examples at three levels of complexity:
  1. Simple: Core banking transactions (fund transfers, balance inquiries)
  2. Moderate: Payment processing systems (card transactions, ACH)
  3. Complex: Trading platforms and wealth management
  
- **Real-World Scenarios**: Use anonymized but realistic banking incident scenarios to illustrate concepts
- **System-Specific Applications**: Apply concepts to specific banking systems from the Domain Adaptation document:
  - Payment processing systems
  - Core banking platforms
  - Digital banking channels
  - Trading systems
  - Regulatory reporting frameworks

- **Regulatory Alignment**: Connect reliability concepts to specific regulations mentioned in the document:
  - FCA Operational Resilience requirements
  - PSD2 service availability expectations
  - Basel Committee guidance

- **Business Impact Focus**: Emphasize the business connections outlined in the document:
  - Revenue loss quantification
  - Customer experience metrics
  - Operational efficiency improvements
  - Risk management enhancement

This balanced approach will maintain the primary focus on SRE concepts while providing sufficient banking context to make the material relevant and immediately applicable for production support professionals transitioning to SRE roles in financial services environments.
