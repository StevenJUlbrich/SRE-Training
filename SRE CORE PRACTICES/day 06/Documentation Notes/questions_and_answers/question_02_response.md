# SRE Training Materials: Service-Level Indicators, Objectives, and Error Budgets

## 1. Scope and Boundaries of SLIs, SLOs, and Error Budgets

### Scope
The training material will cover the fundamental concepts, implementation approaches, and operational practices of Service-Level Indicators (SLIs), Service-Level Objectives (SLOs), and Error Budgets specifically tailored for banking environments. We'll focus on the transition from traditional IT operations monitoring to modern reliability engineering practices.

### Boundaries
- **In Scope**: Defining, implementing, measuring, and operationalizing SLIs, SLOs, and Error Budgets in banking systems
- **Out of Scope**: Detailed infrastructure implementation, extensive coding solutions, or deep dives into specific monitoring tools beyond conceptual integration

## 2. Core Principles and Concepts

### Foundational Concepts
- **Service-Level Indicators (SLIs)**: Key metrics that directly measure customer experience aspects of a service
  - Types of SLIs (availability, latency, throughput, error rates)
  - Banking-specific SLIs (transaction success rates, settlement completion, compliance verification)
  - SLI implementation through logs, metrics, and traces

- **Service-Level Objectives (SLOs)**: Target values for SLIs that define acceptable service performance
  - Setting realistic SLOs for critical banking services
  - Differentiating between internal and external SLOs
  - Tiered SLOs for different service criticality levels
  - Regulatory considerations in SLO establishment

- **Error Budgets**: The acceptable amount of unreliability in a service
  - Calculating and tracking error budgets
  - Error budget policies and decision frameworks
  - Using error budgets to balance reliability and innovation
  - Communicating error budget status to technical and non-technical stakeholders

### Advanced Concepts
- **SLI/SLO Maturity Models**: Progressive implementation approaches
- **Multi-dimensional SLOs**: Complex service quality definitions
- **Error Budget Allocation**: Distributing reliability across components
- **SLO-based Alerting**: Moving from threshold-based to SLO-based alerting strategies
- **Continuous Improvement**: Using historical SLI data to refine SLOs

## 3. Banking/Financial Services Context

### Industry-Specific Applications
- **Core Banking Systems**: Transaction processing, account management, ledger systems
- **Payment Processing**: Card transactions, wire transfers, ACH, RTGS, and instant payment systems
- **Trading Platforms**: Order management, execution, settlement systems
- **Wealth Management**: Portfolio management, reporting systems
- **Customer-Facing Services**: Mobile banking, online banking, ATMs

### Unique Banking Considerations
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meeting financial regulatory requirements (Basel III, PSD2, GDPR) through reliability metrics
- **Transaction Integrity**: Ensuring consistent financial data across distributed systems
- **Security Integration**: Balancing reliability with security concerns
- **Business Hours vs. 24/7 Services**: Different reliability expectations
- **Batch vs. Real-time Processing**: Distinct reliability metrics for different processing models
- **Financial Impact Quantification**: Translating reliability metrics into monetary values

### Banking-Specific Challenges
- **Legacy System Integration**: Implementing modern SRE practices in legacy banking infrastructure
- **Heterogeneous Technology Landscape**: Managing reliability across diverse platforms
- **Change Management Constraints**: Working within strict change windows and approval processes
- **Third-party Dependencies**: Measuring reliability across organizational boundaries
- **Data Consistency Requirements**: Ensuring financial data integrity

This framework provides a comprehensive foundation for developing our SRE training materials on SLIs, SLOs, and Error Budgets specifically tailored for banking professionals transitioning from production support roles. The content will progressively build from foundational to advanced concepts, with practical banking examples throughout.
