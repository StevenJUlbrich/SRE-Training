        Within each Teaching Narrative section, the content must balance technical instruction (approx. 60-80%) with scene-setting, storytelling, dialogue, and reader engagement (approx. 20-40%).
        Importantly, technical content should be integrated into the narrative flow, presented in a conversational style, and woven into storytelling elements rather than listed or explained separately in a dry manner. Explicit "Scene (X%)" and "Technical (Y%)" labels should NOT be included in the generated Markdown output. The ratio should be achieved implicitly through content composition.

    perspective: "second-person teacher + narrative examples"
    prose_style: |
      Fully narrative, conversational, detailed, and engaging. The conversational tone should feel like a mentor directly speaking to the reader, actively incorporating dialogue, relatable anecdotes, rhetorical questions, and direct prompts to the reader. Technical details and explanations should be seamlessly integrated into this narrative and conversational flow. Explicitly avoid bullet points or lists unless strictly necessary for clarity of technical steps or examples.
      Integrate storytelling elements, vivid descriptions, and Kenyan analogies or cultural references where appropriate, fulfilling the voice guidelines.

    - "Word count within 7800–10000 band in the main content Markdown prose (excluding code, tables, etc.)."
    - "Prose word count within each Teaching Narrative section is between 1200 and 1500 words (excluding code, tables, etc.)." # Updated checklist item for chunk size adherence
    - "Cadence pattern within sections alternates narrative blocks/elements with image embeds/diagrams, followed optionally by voice widgets."
    - "Image count 6–15 in the external image data file's panels array."
    - "Each panel definition object in the external image data file's 'panels' array matches the external_image_data_schema."
    - "Each conceptual 'Image Embed' point in the cadence is represented by a Markdown image line referencing an existing panel by filename from the external data."
    - "Mermaid diagrams compile correctly (if used as inline code blocks)."
    - "Ava appears in ≥ 50 % of panels defined in the external image data file's 'panels' array."
    - "Teaching Narrative sections meet storytelling_ratio (20-40% scene, 60-80% tech), **without explicit Scene/Technical labels**."
    - "Banking context anchor is clearly present per unit/section."
    - "Voice guideline elements (Swahili proverb OR Wrist-Slap Moment OR Dialogue Line OR Learner Prompt) are included as appropriate within each unit/Teaching Narrative section."
    - "Swahili proverb and Wrist-Slap Moment widgets are correctly placed after a related image embed when applicable, as per voice_widget_placement rule."
    - "Applied Example block is present directly after each Takeaway section and matches its conceptual content (code snippet + user impact note)."
    - "Teaching Narrative prose is explicitly detailed, narrative, conversational, and avoids superficial summaries or excessive bullet points unless necessary. **Technical content is integrated into this narrative flow.**"

  ambiguity_handling:
    explicit_instruction: |
      If uncertain about the level of detail required for prose narratives, how to integrate technical content conversationally, how to apply storytelling/banking context/voice guidelines (including widget placement), how to use inline widgets, how to reference external image data, or any other rule for generating the Markdown output, explicitly pause and request clarification—never default to condensed or overly summarized output.

  escalation_rule: |
    If any checklist item fails, return the checklist table with ❌ items and halt content generation until resolved.
