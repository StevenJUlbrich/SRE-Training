      By the end of this chapter, you'll understand the fundamental shift from traditional IT operations to Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), grasp the core concepts of SLIs, SLOs, and Error Budgets, and recognize the unique reliability challenges faced within the banking industry.

      Reliability isn't just about keeping the lights on anymore; it's a strategic advantage built on clearly defined objectives (SLOs) derived from measurable indicators (SLIs), managed actively using Error Budgets to balance stability with innovation, especially critical in the high-stakes world of banking.

      *Harambee!* Welcome, my friends, to a journey that will change how you think about keeping our digital world running smoothly. My name is Ava Kimani, and I've spent more years than I care to admit in the trenches of technology, particularly in the bustling, ever-demanding heart of the banking sector right here in Nairobi. You know, for the longest time, our job in operations felt like being a firefighter. The pager would go off, a siren would wail in your mind, and you'd rush in, hose in hand, trying to douse the flames of a production issue. Fix it quick, get things back to "normal," and then wait for the next fire. It was reactive, stressful, and honestly, not the most sustainable way to build trust with our customers or our business partners. We were good at fighting fires, mind you, like a skilled *mganga* knows just the right herbs for a persistent ailment, but we weren't preventing them. We weren't building systems that were inherently resilient to the sparks.

      The pressure in banking is immense, isn't it? Every transaction, every login, every customer interaction carries a weight of trust and financial security. A few minutes of downtime isn't just inconvenient; it can mean significant financial losses, damage to reputation, and a breach of the trust that customers place in us with their hard-earned money. We learned this the hard way, more times than I'd like to remember. There was one time, during a critical system upgrade, when a seemingly small oversight cascaded into a multi-hour outage that affected ATM services across three counties. The calls were relentless, the panic was palpable, and the fix felt like patching a bursting dam with chewing gum. It was a wake-up call. We realized that simply reacting to failure wasn't enough. We needed a different approach, a proactive strategy to ensure our systems weren't just functional, but truly *reliable*.

      This realization is the heart of the reliability revolution that has been sweeping through the tech world, and which is absolutely vital for us in banking. It's the shift from asking "Is it working?" to "How well is it working, for whom, and how do we keep it working well even when things go wrong?" This is where Site Reliability Engineering, or SRE, comes into play. It's not just a job title; it's a philosophy, a set of practices, and a culture that aims to bridge the gap between development and operations, using engineering principles to operate production systems reliably. Itâ€™s about setting clear expectations, measuring performance from the user's perspective, and making data-driven decisions about when to prioritize reliability work over launching new features. Itâ€™s about moving from firefighting to fire prevention, building systems as robust as the ancient baobab trees that withstand any storm. At the core of SRE are three key concepts that act as our compass: Service Level Indicators (SLIs), Service Level Objectives (SLOs), and Error Budgets. These aren't just technical jargon; they are the language of reliability, helping us define, measure, and manage how dependable our services are for the people who use them every single day. Understanding these will change how you view system health and guide your efforts towards building a truly reliable banking platform.

        [Scene: Ava Kimani, a warm and knowledgeable SRE mentor, stands in a modern, but slightly chaotic, server room environment. Cables are visible, perhaps a blinking server rack in the background, but Ava is in the foreground, smiling reassuringly at the viewer. She gestures towards a jumbled mess in one corner (representing traditional reactive IT) and towards a clearer, more organized path leading off-panel (representing SRE). Include subtle Kenyan decor elements or patterns in the room to ground the location in Nairobi. Ava (primary character) is clearly present.]

# Continue with alternating Prose and Image Embed sections for Chapter 1, covering the remaining topics:
# - The shift from traditional production support to proactive reliability (continued)
# - Overview of SLIs, SLOs, and Error Budgets
# - Banking industry reliability challenges (continued)
# Ensure each subsequent prose block is 400-600 words and alternates with an Image Embed following the panel_json schema.
# Remember to include Ava in at least 50% of the total panels for the entire novella.
# Track total word count and image count across all chapters to stay within the 7000-10000 word and 8-15 image limits for the complete novella.
