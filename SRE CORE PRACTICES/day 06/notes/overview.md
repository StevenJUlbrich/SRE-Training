# Project Summary: SRE Training Materials Development

## Project Overview
This conversation focused on developing comprehensive Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) training materials for banking industry professionals transitioning from production support to SRE roles. The materials feature a fictional character, Ava Kimani ("The SLO Sentinel"), as the voice and guide, with content structured across beginner, intermediate, and advanced tiers.

## Character Development

### Primary Character: Ava Kimani
- 38-year-old Senior SRE from Nairobi, Kenya with 15 years of experience
- Physical traits: 5'7", athletic build, dark brown skin, shoulder-length dreadlocks with red highlights
- Personality: Direct, warm but firm, pragmatic problem-solver, storyteller
- Catchphrase: "Reliability you can measure is the only reliability that matters"
- Teaching style: Uses Kenyan analogies, "slaps wrists" for vanity metrics, balances technical rigor with accessibility
- Superhero title: "The SLO Sentinel"

### Supporting Characters
1. **Malik Odhiambo** (Male, 42) - Former banking CTO, methodical mentor with institutional knowledge
2. **Zuri Wanjiku** (Female, 27) - Innovative DevOps lead from fintech background
3. **Jamal Kimeu** (Male, 35) - Customer Experience Director who uses a wheelchair, focuses on user perspective

### Learner Characters
1. **Wanjiru Maina** (Female, 24) - Junior developer with strong coding skills but limited ops experience
2. **Emmanuel "Manu" Gitonga** (Male, 31) - Production support veteran transitioning to SRE
3. **Aisha Omar** (Female, 29) - Former business analyst bridging business and technical requirements
4. **Daniel "Danny" Mutua** (Male, 26) - Startup hire adapting to banking environment
5. **Njeri Wachira** (Non-binary, 33) - Network engineer learning full-stack reliability

## Curriculum Structure
The training is organized into three tiers, each designed for 3-4 days of instruction:

### Beginner Tier
- Foundations of SRE
- Understanding service level concepts (SLAs, SLOs, SLIs)
- Introduction to error budgets
- Basic monitoring implementation
- First SLO implementation
- Shifting from reactive to proactive support

### Intermediate Tier
- Advanced SLI development
- Error budget management
- SLO-based alerting strategies
- Reliability in AWS and Kubernetes environments
- Applied SRE for banking services
- SLO visualization and reporting

### Advanced Tier
- Statistical approaches to SLOs
- Multi-team SLO management
- Sophisticated error budget frameworks
- SLO-driven development
- Reliability forecasting and modeling
- Building world-class SRE culture

## Content Development

### Introduction Section
A ~2500-word introduction was created, establishing Ava's voice and introducing core SRE concepts with banking-specific examples and analogies.

### Format Evolution
The project evolved from traditional documentation to a hybrid illustrated novella format, combining prose sections with sequential art panels to enhance engagement while preserving educational depth.

### Visual Style Recommendations
- **Color Palette**: Deep indigo blue, vibrant orange, teal, warm gray, soft white, accent red
- **Line Style**: Clean, medium-weight lines with semi-realistic style and stylized proportions
- **Layout**: 2-4 panels per concept, clear separation between prose and illustrations

## Project Scope

### Target Length
- 80-120 pages total
- 20,000-30,000 words
- 50-60% text and 40-50% visuals

### Chapter Structure
The content is organized into 12 main chapters plus an appendix:
- Part I: Foundations (Beginner Tier) - 5 chapters
- Part II: Implementation (Intermediate Tier) - 4 chapters
- Part III: Mastery (Advanced Tier) - 3 chapters
- Appendix with practical worksheets and resources

Each chapter includes opening illustrations, narrative text, panel sequences, character interactions, insight callouts, practical exercises, and chapter summaries.

## Technologies Covered
The curriculum incorporates instruction on Prometheus, Grafana, Kubernetes, AWS, and Splunk, with practical exercises throughout to reinforce learning.

## Next Steps
This documentation provides a comprehensive foundation for developing the complete illustrated SRE training novella. Development would require collaboration with illustrators and instructional designers to bring the concepts and characters to life while maintaining technical accuracy and educational value.
