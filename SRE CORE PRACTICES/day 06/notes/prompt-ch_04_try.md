**Scene**
Interior – 02:47 AM, Daniel’s one-room flat in Nairobi. The only light is a Rust Red (#8B2E2E) PagerDuty banner reflecting off a Charcoal Black (#1C1C1E) wall. A battered laptop shows a CPU chart pinned at 87 %. A steaming ceramic mug sits beside it. Slack overlays hover like ghosts above Daniel’s phone; Hector’s avatar appears in an off-white bubble, underscoring the midnight tension. Wall-mounted monitors glow with muted dark-mode dashboards. Quiet hum of fans and distant city noise amplify the stillness.

### Dialogue

Daniel: “Legacy spreadsheet said CPU cost money. So we page.”
Juana: “Let me guess. Geneos rule from 2009?”
Hector: “Daniel, stop admiring server sweat. If customers aren’t screaming, go back to bed.”
Juana (again): “Users cost more. Where’s their metric in that alert?”

*“Static thresholds jolt Daniel awake while customers sleep fine.”*

* Interfaces in dark mode; telemetry graphs muted yet readable
* Quiet tension over high drama; smart people versus complex systems
* No motion blur or watermarks; full-bleed panel unless otherwise required
