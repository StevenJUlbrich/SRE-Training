# Chapter 1 – The Reliability Revolution

---

## 🌟 Chapter Overview
Welcome to the beginning of your reliability journey. Ava Kimani, our guide, introduces us to a new mindset: moving from reactive firefighting to proactive reliability engineering. Through relatable banking examples, she'll show why measuring user experience through SLIs, SLOs, and managing Error Budgets is essential—not optional—for modern banking success.

---

## 🌟 Learning Objective
Understand how the shift from traditional production support to proactive Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) practices, using SLIs, SLOs, and Error Budgets, improves trust and performance in the banking sector.

---

## ✅ Takeaway
Reliability is a measurable promise to users, not an abstract goal. Through SLIs, SLOs, and Error Budgets, banks can predictably deliver user trust and operational resilience.

---

## 🚦 Applied Example
Consider a mobile banking app. It shows "100% uptime" but silently fails 1 in 20 bill payments. Uptime isn't enough—what matters is the successful completion of user-critical transactions. Only by measuring real user outcomes with SLIs/SLOs can a bank spot and solve hidden problems.
