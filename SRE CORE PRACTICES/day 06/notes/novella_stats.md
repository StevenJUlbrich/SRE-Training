For an illustrated novella combining prose and graphic panels to teach SRE concepts , I'd recommend targeting approximately:


1. **Digestible Sections:** The content could be divided into 10-12 , making it easy to consume in multiple sittings

2. **Sufficient Depth:** This length allows enough space to cover the beginner concepts thoroughly while providing meaningful introductions to intermediate and advanced topics

3. **Visual-Text Balance:** Approximately 50-60% text and 40-50% visuals would maintain engagement while delivering substantive educational content

4. **Production Feasibility:** This scope is substantial enough to be valuable but not so large that it becomes unwieldy to produce or update

5. **Industry Standard:** This length is comparable to other successful technical illustrated guides like "The Manga Guide to Statistics" (224 pages) or "Google's SRE Workbook" (about 500 pages of dense text), but more focused and approachable
