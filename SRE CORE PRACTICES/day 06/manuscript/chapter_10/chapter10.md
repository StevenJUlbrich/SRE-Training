# Chapter 10 – Proactive Capacity Planning
---

### Chapter Overview (≈ 500 words)

Three truths guide every bank that aspires to five-nines reliability. **First**, traffic is rarely smooth; it travels in spiky herds driven by payday schedules, marketing pushes, and viral hashtags. **Second**, hardware may be “elastic,” but it still takes minutes to spin, warm, and surface in a load-balancer—minutes that devour error-budget when a flash surge lands. **Third**, cloud invoices do not shrink out of sympathy; over-provisioning silently bleeds profit even while the SLO dial stays green.  

For years the fund-transfer team reacted to spikes with a frantic dance of node scale-outs and hope. One afternoon they provisioned 60 extra c5.4xlarge instances during a social-media giveaway, only to discover the campaign had ended while the instances still munched dollars overnight. This chapter ends that dance. **Ava Kimani** partners with **Achieng Otieno**, the bank’s no-nonsense CFO, to turn capacity from a guessing game into a data-driven contract that balances cost and trust.

We will begin by contrasting a painful reactive incident—a queue saturation freeze that cost two hours of budget and USD 4 200 in burst capacity—with a proactive forecast generated a month earlier that would have prevented both. You’ll learn to extract six months of TPS data from Prometheus, pipe it into **Facebook Prophet** for seasonality-aware forecasting, and translate the 95-percentile demand curve into concrete vCPU, memory, and node-count targets with a 20 percent head-room SLO. Next, we build regression models that map **business drivers** (marketing e-mails, public holidays, FX-volatility indices) to resource needs, producing a “what-if” Excel-savvy view for finance.

Ava then codifies placement logic—nodes spread evenly across three AZs, one extra per zone to tolerate a drain, and an automated Savings-Plan calculator that locks in discounts for the base load while leaving space for spot agility. Horizontal and vertical autoscalers become guard-rails, not crutches: scale-in floors prevent thrashing, scale-out ceilings protect the wallet, and both obey the **head-room SLO** so burn-rate alerts stay quiet.

Finally, you’ll integrate capacity plans with GitHub: each quarterly forecast becomes a pull request containing Terraform diff, Grafana budget dashboards, and an **approval gate from the finance team**. If marketing schedules a surprise promo, a calendar overlay flashes amber and triggers a mid-quarter re-forecast. By chapter’s end, Achieng will sign the capacity plan with a smile, the reliability badge will stay green through payday spikes, and the cloud bill will recede by 18 percent without sacrificing a single nine.

## 🎯 Learning Objective  

Build a Prometheus → Prophet forecasting pipeline, translate the 95-percentile forecast into multi-AZ node counts with 20 % head-room, and automate pull-request–based capacity plans jointly reviewed by finance and SRE.

## ✅ Takeaway  

Capacity planning is reliability paid forward: forecast, fund, and pre-provision before customers feel the squeeze.

## 🚦 Applied Example (≈ 170 words)

Six months of `requests_total` for the fund-transfer API feed a Prophet model that exposes weekly cycle (+42 %), fortnight payroll surge (+28 %), and an upward trend of 3.1 %/month. Prophet predicts a month-end peak of **2 450 TPS**. The capacity model says each pod handles 110 TPS at 60 % CPU; with 20 % head-room the service requires **26 pods**. Karpenter node-type `c6i.large` fits three pods each, so **nine nodes** across three AZs satisfy demand with one spare per zone.  

Cost model:  
* Reserved base (6 nodes × 730 h) → USD 1 850/mo (Savings Plan –38 %).  
* Spot buffer (3 nodes worst-case) → USD 420/mo.  

During the next payday, actual peak hits 2 360 TPS; pods auto-scale from 18 → 24; head-room dips to 22 % yet latency p99 hovers at 275 ms—well below the 300 ms SLO. No burn-rate alert fires, and AWS cost stays within 3 % of forecast.

## Teaching Narrative 1 – *Reactive vs Proactive

> ![Cost line shoots up during reactive scale-out; proactive forecast would have smoothed cost and head-room.](images/ch10_p01_reactive_vs_proactive.png){width=650}

### 1.1 The Reactive Horror Story  
At 09:07 on 30 June, the queue depth panel flat-lined amber; p99 latency pierced 1 250 ms; the fast-burn alert bellowed. Daniel scaled the HPA from 12 → 40 pods; Karpenter added 14 nodes—all in us-east-1a because *that* subnet still had IPs. Ten minutes later AWS throttled the NAT gateway; error ratio climbed; Twitter lit. Total damage: **2 h 14 m of error-budget**, USD 4 200 in burst nodes, and an executive escalations bridge.

### 1.2 Cost of Panic  
Ava overlays AWS cost explorer: the blue bar on 30 June surges higher than the entire previous week. Finance labels it “panic tax.” Risk Officer labels it “preventable.”

### 1.3 Anatomy of a Proactive Plan  
Ava rewinds data 30 days before: the Prophet forecast predicted 2 400 TPS ± 8 %. A pre-provisioned node in each AZ plus a 25 % head-room target would have absorbed the surge, autoscaled gradually, and shaved USD 3 600 off the bill.

### 1.4 Key Lesson  
Reactive scaling equals “borrow reliability at loan-shark rates.” Proactive planning takes the loan the day before payday at prime plus one.

## Teaching Narrative 2 – *Demand Forecasting 101

> ![Prophet forecast chart with weekly seasonality bands.](images/ch10_p02_forecast.png){width=650}

### 2.1 Extracting History  
Raj uses the Prometheus HTTP API:

```bash
curl -g 'http://prom:9090/api/v1/query_range?query=sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m]))&start=...'
```

He dumps six months into CSV with columns `ds, y`.

### 2.2 Prophet Primer  
Facebook Prophet handles seasonality, holidays, and changepoints:

```python
from prophet import Prophet
m = Prophet(weekly_seasonality=True, yearly_seasonality=False)
m.add_country_holidays(country_name='KE')
m.fit(df)
future = m.make_future_dataframe(periods=30, freq='H')
forecast = m.predict(future)
```

Prophet reveals:  
* Weekly Saturday lull −25 %.  
* End-of-month payroll spike +28 %.  
* Upward trend 0.7 %/week.

### 2.3 Confidence Intervals & Risk Tolerance  
Ava chooses the **95th percentile** forecast (P95) to satisfy the latency SLO head-room SLO. CFO Achieng demands cost trade-off: P90 would save 18 % cost but risk two burn-rate alerts per quarter.

### 2.4 Export to Git  
Forecast CSV lands in `capacity-plans/2025-Q3/forecast.csv`; a Git pre-commit hook blocks commits lacking Prophet metadata (version, changepoint count).

:::proverb

## Teaching Narrative 3 – *Head-Room SLOs* 

> ![Head-room gauge showing 25 % buffer; Ava explains to Achieng.](images/ch10_p03_headroom_slo.png){width=650}

### 3.1 Error-Budget vs Capacity-Budget  
Latency SLO: p99 ≤ 300 ms, 99.9 % success. Ava defines a **head-room SLO**: **≥ 20 % spare vCPU** **AND** **queue depth ≤ 60 %** across all AZs. Burning head-room is like burning error-budget in advance.

### 3.2 Translating Forecast to Nodes  
Forecast P95 TPS ÷ 110 TPS per pod = pods. Pods ÷ 3 AZs = per-AZ replicas. Replica × per-pod CPU = node vCPU. Formula codified in a Python notebook committed to repo.

### 3.3 Dialogue  

:::dialogue  
**Ava:** “Twenty-percent buffer is our insurance.”  
**Achieng:** “And the premium?”  
**Ava:** “USD 1 400/month—cheaper than a Twitter riot.”  
:::

### 3.4 Grafana Head-Room Gauge  
Panel query:

```promql
1 - avg(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode!="idle"}[1m])
```

Thresholds: 🟢 ≤ 0.75 utilisation, 🟡 0.75–0.85, 🔴 > 0.85. Alert fires when head-room < 15 % for 10 m.

### 3.5 Wrist-Slap Moment

> ![Regression scatter plot: TPS vs pods vs CPU](images/ch10_p04_cap_model.png){width=650}

### 4.1  From Intuition to Equation  
Historically the team guessed: “One more node per 500 TPS.” Ava replaces guesswork with a multivariate regression:

```python
import statsmodels.api as sm
X = df[["tps","avg_payload_kb","fx_pair_entropy"]]
y = df["vCPU"]
model = sm.OLS(y, sm.add_constant(X)).fit()
```

Result:  

\[
vCPU = 1.7 + 0.028\,\text{TPS} + 0.11\,\text{payload} + 3.4\,H
\]

where \(H\) is Shannon entropy of FX pairs—capturing cache-miss churn.

### 4.2  Confidence & Guard-Bands  
R-squared = 0.94. 95 % interval at forecast point ±1.8 vCPU → translated to one extra node.  Ava encodes the model in a Python package (`capmodel==0.3.1`) imported by the forecasting CI job.

## Teaching Narrative 5 – *Multi-AZ Placement & Cost*  <!-- ~900 w shown -->

> ![Cost table: AZ spread vs single-AZ](images/ch10_p05_multi_az_cost.png){width=650}

### 5.1  Spread Strategy  
Nodes spread 3-3-3 across AZs, plus one spare = 10 nodes. Latency penalty: +2 ms. Cost +12 % vs single-AZ but avoids 33 % budget hit during an AZ outage.

### 5.2  Placement Algorithm  
Karpenter provisioner:

```yaml
zones:
  - us-east-1a
  - us-east-1b
  - us-east-1c
weight: 1
consolidationPolicy: WhenUnderutilized
```

Ava adds subnet-free-IP monitor; warns when any subnet < 100 IPs.

### 5.3  Trade-Off Table  

| Strategy  | Cost Δ   | Burn-Rate Impact | Regulator Risk |
| --------- | -------- | ---------------- | -------------- |
| Single-AZ | −12 %    | +2 h budget/yr   | High           |
| 2-AZ      | baseline | +17 min/yr       | Medium         |
| **3-AZ**  | +12 %    | **+3 min/yr**    | Low            |

Achieng signs the 12 % premium as “insurance cheaper than fines.”

> ![Savings-Plan bar chart](images/ch10_p06_savings_plan.png){width=650}

### 6.1  Dialogue

:::dialogue  
**Achieng:** “Buy 1-year All-Upfront?”  
**Ava:** “No—partial upfront, 1-year, compute-SP. Flexibility wins.”  
:::

### 6.2  Baseline vs Spike  
Base = 6 nodes (on-demand cost USD 1 850). Compute Savings Plan @38 % cuts to 1 147. Spike nodes stay on-demand/spot. Total monthly cost = 1 567 (-15 %).  

### 6.3  RI Calculator  
Ava’s Python script hits AWS Pricing API; flags when baseline >75 % of observed minimum—candidate for SP.

## Teaching Narrative 9 – *Auto-Scaling Guard-Rails*  <!-- condensed preview ~900 w; full version ≈ 1 630 w on disk -->

> ![Guard-rail diagram: scale-in floor, scale-out ceiling](images/ch10_p09_autoscaling_guards.png){width=650}

Ava converts head-room maths into Karpenter limits:

```yaml
limits:
  resources:
    cpu:    70        # scale-in floor: utilisation <=70 %
    memory: 75
safetyBuffer: 20      # never consume last 20 % head-room
maxPodsPerNode: 30    # scale-out ceiling guard
```

Fast-burn alert mutates these limits via the Karpenter API, temporarily blocking further scale-in if head-room < 20 %. A Slack bot posts the guard-rail state so finance sees when the cluster is “locked high.”

> ![Calendar heat-map overlay for promos/holidays](images/ch10_p10_seasonal_overlay.png){width=650}

Marketing exports promo dates (CSV) to S3; Prophet seasonality model imports them as “special_regressors.” Grafana heat-map overlays surge risk—cells turn amber in the fortnight before “Summer Cash-Back.” A mid-quarter re-forecast auto-opens a PR adding three nodes for the promo window.

Dashboard mash-up:

* **Head-room compliance** sparkline.  
* **Cost vs forecast** bar (Δ ≤ ±5 % target).  
* **SLO breaches** count.
