# Chapter 2 ‚Äì Understanding Your Users‚Äô Experience

### Chapter Overview  

Banking reliability isn‚Äôt measured in server-room decibels but in heartbeats and sighs. Picture a Nairobi commuter tapping **‚ÄúSend ‚Çµ4 500‚Äù** at 07:58, glancing at the matatu conductor, then refreshing her phone every half-second until the spinner vanishes. Those nerve-wracking seconds‚Äî**moments that matter**‚Äîshape brand loyalty far more than any uptime graph. In this chapter Ava Kimani guides you through mapping those moments, separating system metrics from user emotions, and turning empathy into precise, experience-centric SLIs.

---

## üéØ Learning Objective  

Define a retail-bank customer journey, locate the emotional high-stakes touchpoints, and convert them into SLIs that capture **time-to-trust** rather than CPU idle time.

## ‚úÖ Takeaway  

Customers remember feelings, not log lines. Quantify the feelings (with latency, success-ratio and visibility metrics) and you can guard them with data.

## üö¶ Applied Example  

On payday, many Kenyans receive an in-app push notification‚Äî**‚ÄúSalary deposited!‚Äù**‚Äîseconds after their company batch file posts to the core-bank queue. But ledger replication sometimes lags; the balance widget still shows last month‚Äôs figure and a rent auto-debit fires, triggering an overdraft fee.  

```
Timeline (seconds)
0  | Payroll job inserts credit row
1  | Push notification dispatched ‚úÖ
4  | Replication delay ‚Ä¶
8  | Balance API returns stale data ‚ùå
15 | Auto-debit hits, fee posted üò°
```

Ava‚Äôs draft SLO:

```yaml
slo: "Balance visible within 5 s after credit POST 99.5% over 30d"
indicator:
  numerator: count_success(balance_api_latency_seconds_bucket{le="5"})
  denominator: count_total(balance_api_requests_total)
```

Miss the SLO and you hemorrhage trust‚Äîand overdraft investigations cost KSh 120 per case.

## Teaching Narrative 1 ‚Äì *Moments That Matter*  

It‚Äôs Friday 16:20. Teller windows glow amber in the low sun. **Wanjiru**, junior developer on rotation at a downtown branch, watches a queue coil toward the door. A boy waves school-fee cash; his mother stares at her frozen phone.  

**Ava (whispering):** ‚ÄúSee that spinner?‚Äù  
**Wanjiru:** ‚ÄúAPI latency‚Äôs fine; logs show 230 ms.‚Äù  
**Ava:** ‚ÄúLatency where? Between gateway and microservice‚Äînot gateway and mother‚Äôs heartbeat.‚Äù  

Ava opens her laptop, runs `traceroute ‚ÄìT` between phone and ledger, revealing a four-hop detour through a creaky firewall. She overlays the hops on a heat-map of emotional states‚Äîgreen calm, red anxiety.  

> **Scene (technical):** She correlates branch Wi-Fi RTT data with queue abandonment stats‚Äî1 % of customers bail for every additional second their balance is invisible.  

She introduces the term **‚Äúmicro-moment‚Äù**: the smallest slice of time in which your brand can delight or disappoint. For a balance check the micro-moment spans **tap ‚Üí updated figure**.  

Formula:

```
time_to_trust = t_visible - t_intent
```

‚â• 6 s triggers ‚Äúdoubt‚Äù per UX lab. Ava sketches five mobile moments: login, balance, fund-transfer, bill-pay receipt, push-alert confirmation. The team will measure each.

## Teaching Narrative 2 ‚Äì *Golden Signals vs Human Sentiment*  

**Emmanuel** projects Prometheus graphs: CPU 25 %, p99 latency 280 ms, error 0.07 %. Everything looks green. Yet Twitter searches for *#KCBDelay* spike 200 %.  

**Ava:** ‚ÄúGolden signals are necessary but not sufficient.‚Äù  
**Daniel:** ‚ÄúSo what fills the gap?‚Äù  
**Ava:** ‚ÄúSentiment signals: abandonment rate, repeat taps, complaint tweets.‚Äù  

:::diagram  
```mermaid

  A(Golden Signals<br/>Latency/Traffic/Errors/Saturation)
  B(Sentiment Signals<br/>Spinner duration, repeat click count, tweets/min)
  C(Experience SLI)

  B --> C
```  
:::

She layers sentiment curves atop system metrics: as latency climbs from 280 ‚Üí 320 ms, complaints **exponentially** rise. They plot Pearson r = 0.88.  

**Swahili proverb break:**  

:::proverb  
> ‚ÄúAliyesikia, ameona.‚Äù ‚Äî *He who listens has already seen.* When customers speak, graphs should echo.  
:::  

Ava crystallises an **Experience Pyramid**: hardware ‚Üí service ‚Üí feature ‚Üí emotion. CPU sits at the base; trust crowns the top. Measure at every tier, but set **SLOs near the crown**.

## Teaching Narrative 3 ‚Äì *Journey-Mapping Workshop*  

Whiteboard markers squeak as Ava draws swim-lanes: **User**, **Mobile App**, **API**, **Core Bank**, **SMS Gateway**. For each lane she plots intent, action, feedback.  

**Ava:** ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs annotate the balance-check journey.‚Äù  
**Wanjiru:** ‚ÄúIntent at t=0, spinner until ledger reply, success toast.‚Äù  
**Ava:** ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the first emotional peak?‚Äù  
**Wanjiru:** ‚ÄúWhen spinner passes 3 s‚Äîanxiety climbs.‚Äù  
**Ava:** ‚ÄúMark it red.‚Äù  

They attach sticky-notes with pain scores.  

```
Step               Pain (1‚Äì5)  Metric gap?
Open App           2           First-paint not tracked
Login              3           Biometric fallback missing
Balance Visible    4           No end-to-end latency SLI
Transfer Receipt   5           Push-alert vs ledger gap
```

Determining **SLI Candidates**:  

* *Balance-visible latency* (`balance_visible‚â§5 s`)  
* *Receipt delivery lag* (`sms_confirm‚â§8 s`)  
* *Spinner abandon rate* (`tap_abort_ratio‚â§0.02`)  

**Dialogue exchange extended:**  

**Malik:** ‚ÄúShould we SLI every red step?‚Äù  
**Ava:** ‚ÄúPole pole, ndio mwendo. Start with the largest pain-weighted cost.‚Äù  
**Malik:** ‚ÄúSo balance visible wins.‚Äù  
**Ava:** ‚ÄúExactly‚Äîhigh pain and high frequency.‚Äù  

![Alt text](images/ch02_p03_journey_whiteboard.png){width=600}

:::dialogue  
**Ava:** ‚ÄúData tells you **what**, journey maps tell you **why**.‚Äù  
**Learner:** ‚ÄúAnd together they decide **where** to invest.‚Äù

## Teaching Narrative 4 ‚Äì *Capturing ‚ÄúTime to Trust‚Äù*  

Developers often brag about **request latency** while ignoring **acknowledgment latency**. Ava coins **TtT** (Time-to-Trust): the interval from intent to verifiable completion.  

Formula:

```
TtT = t_feedback - t_intent
```

where *feedback* is a balance change, receipt toast, or SMS.  

She instruments the mobile client to emit a synthetic **UX-span** tagged `intent_id`. Span pairs with server logs; distributed-trace waterfall now shows a 2 s gap after 0.3 s request.  

**Ava (slaps wrist):** ‚ÄúAverage API_latency 280 ms is a vanity metric if TtT is 2 s!‚Äù  
**Daniel:** ‚ÄúCPU‚Äôs 15 %; we‚Äôre fine.‚Äù  
**Ava:** ‚ÄúLet me stop you right there. *Watoto wa mjini hawalali na njaa.* City kids don‚Äôt sleep hungry; customers won‚Äôt tolerate hidden latency.‚Äù  

She correlates TtT > 5 s with a 12 % rise in abandoned transfers, equating to KSh 4 M monthly lost float revenue.  

![Alt text](images/ch02_p04_time_to_trust.png){width=600}

:::slap  
*Playfully slaps wrist* ‚ÄúStop worshipping CPU graphs‚Äîworship your customer‚Äôs patience threshold!‚Äù

### Teaching Narrative 5 ‚Äì *Quantifying Friction Points*  <!-- ‚âà 1 300 words -->
Ava exports two weeks of mobile-app session traces into DuckDB and runs a heat-map query that charts **step-duration (x)** against **drop-off ratio (y)**.  The darkest cell hovers over *Balance Visible > 5 s*.  She converts the heat map into shillings by multiplying each abandoned session‚Äôs lost interchange revenue (KSh 23 average) and discovers a hidden ‚âà KSh 1.8 million monthly leak.

‚ÄúPain has a price-tag,‚Äù she says, projecting a color-bar legend that starts at **green = KSh 0** and ends at **scarlet = KSh 100 000** per hour.  A silent gasp ripples across the room.

> **Technical aside** ‚Äì She shows the SQL that bins latency into 0.5-second buckets, joins with outcome codes, and aggregates by hour:

```sql
WITH bins AS (
  SELECT
    width_bucket(latency_ms, 0, 10000, 20) AS bucket,
    COUNT(*)                     AS hits,
    SUM(CASE WHEN succeeded THEN 0 ELSE 1 END) AS failures
  FROM ux_spans
  WHERE name = 'balance_visible'
  GROUP BY bucket)
SELECT
  bucket*500   AS upper_ms,
  failures*23  AS shillings_lost
FROM bins;
```

The class now attaches **cost values** to every sticky note on the journey board.

### Teaching Narrative 6 ‚Äì *Segmentation: Personas & Channels*  <!-- ‚âà 1 300 words -->
Reliability perceptions vary by channel.  Ava introduces **four personas**:

| Persona | Channel | Moment-of-Truth |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| *Commuter Kofi* | Mobile LTE | Tap-to-balance |
| *Merchant Amina* | POS | Authorization time |
| *Branch Elder Nyaga* | Teller | Paper receipt |
| *ATM Student Zuri* | ATM | Cash-dispense delay |

She filters `ux_spans` by `device_type` and plots p95 TtT for each persona.  Mobile TtT spikes at evening rush hour, while POS spikes Sunday market mornings.

Dialogue exchange:

**Zuri (DevOps lead):** ‚ÄúDo we need separate SLIs for each persona?‚Äù  
**Ava:** ‚ÄúFocus on any segment whose TtT p99 already exceeds your global SLO.  One broken segment taints the brand for all.‚Äù

She demos `histogram_quantile()` over a label-split Prometheus histogram and adds **channel dimension** to Grafana templating.  CTO Malik sees that ATM latency is fine yet mobile bleeds trust; he approves budget for CDN edge nodes.

### Teaching Narrative 7 ‚Äì *Selecting Experience-Centric SLIs*  <!-- ‚âà 1 300 words -->
Ava prints a 4√ó4 matrix‚Äîrows are journey steps, columns are candidate metrics (latency, success, visibility-delay, sentiment).  Each cell scores *Impact √ó Feasibility*.  The highest composite: **Balance Visible ‚â§ 5 s**.

:::diagram
```mermaid

  subgraph Matrix
    A1["Login<br/>Latency"]:::low

  end
  style Matrix fill:none,stroke:none
  classDef high fill:#ffce00;
  classDef med  fill:#a0d2ff;
  classDef low  fill:#e0e0e0;
```
:::

She drafts three SLIs:

```
balance_visible_latency_p95 ‚â§ 3 s
transfer_receipt_delay_p99 ‚â§ 8 s
spinner_abandon_ratio ‚â§ 0.02
```

**Wanjiru:** ‚ÄúTwo latency, one ratio‚Äîgood mix?‚Äù  
**Ava:** ‚ÄúYes, latency measures speed, ratio measures trust.‚Äù

### Teaching Narrative 8 ‚Äì *Winning Buy-In Across the Bank*  <!-- ‚âà 1 300 words -->
Ava schedules a cross-functional **Reliability Road-show**: risk, customer-care, marketing, core-bank ops.  She shows each stakeholder a mocked-up ‚ÄúTrust Thermometer‚Äù badge: green when SLO ‚â• 99.5 %, amber 99‚Äì99.5, red < 99.  Marketing loves the badge for app-store screenshots; risk loves that overdraft complaints drop when badge is green.

She automates a Slack bot that posts daily TtT compliance to #cx-health.  At 08:15 Monday the badge flips amber.  Teller Wanjiru triggers a feature flag rollback before Twitter notices; the badge returns green by 08:25.
