# Chapter 9 – Observability Deep Dive
---

## Chapter Overview

The last time the fund-transfer service melted down, every metric panel screamed a different story. CPU idled at 35 percent, yet p99 latency doubled. Error-ratio bars stood green, yet call-centre lines jammed. Developers scrolled logs by the kilometer without spotting a single ­ERROR. Only after two bleary hours did someone open a distributed trace and notice an invisible three-second stall in a downstream foreign-exchange (FX) oracle. By then, payrolls had missed their cut-off and Twitter was ablaze.  

That incident cemented a painful lesson: **monitoring ≠ observability**. Monitoring asks *“Is the server on fire?”*; observability asks *“Why are customers burning?”*—and answers within one click. Modern banking demands the latter, because failure sneaks through side doors: a single high-cardinality user label can blow up a Prometheus cluster; a canary deploy can inject latency only for ZAR→KES conversions; a “successful” HTTP 200 can mask a stale FX-rate cached deep inside an L2. Without traces linked to metrics, logs linked to spans, and business-event spikes mapped onto dashboards, the root cause hides in plain sight while error-budget bleeds away.  

In this chapter **Ava Kimani** drafts **Raj Patel**—a former data-platform engineer who once tamed terabytes of Hadoop spill logs—to weave a cohesive observability fabric. They will begin with the **Signal Triad** (metrics, logs, traces) and the RED / USE heuristics, then thread **OpenTelemetry** auto-instrumentation through Java, Go, and Python services. You will see how to enrich spans with business attributes (`fx_pair`, `customer_segment`), push **exemplars** into Prometheus latency buckets, and let Grafana panels hyperlink straight to a guilty trace.  

Cardinality hygiene follows: Raj audits time-series explosions, hashes personally-identifiable labels, and introduces per-job series caps. With **Tempo** he queries traces by business attribute; with **Loki** and **Splunk** he joins error logs to those traces using the shared `trace_id`. Next, they ingest **business events** (Kafka topic `fx_event`) as a *fourth signal*, overlaying geomaps that reveal bursts in South-African conversions long before metrics tip red.  

Finally, they tackle cost controls—tail-sampling pipelines and adaptive exemplar budgets—then institute an “observability debt” scorecard that fails CI if noise ratio exceeds 20 percent. By the end, a single burn-rate alert will reveal *which* customer flow is failing, *where* in the code, *why* it fails, and *how long* before trust evaporates. Observability will no longer be a log buffet; it will be a precision scalpel that slices straight to root cause.

## 🎯 Learning Objective  

Instrument OpenTelemetry in three languages, export metrics + traces + logs to Prometheus / Tempo / Loki, build exemplar-rich Grafana dashboards, and craft three-signal correlations that surface root cause in ≤ 60 seconds.

## ✅ Takeaway  

Observability is the shortest path from SLO breach to root cause—achieved by stitching metrics, traces, logs, and business events around the promises you made.

---

## 🚦 Applied Example

10:04 AM: p99 latency for **“FOREX”** transfers spikes from 280 ms to 920 ms, yet overall latency holds steady. Grafana’s latency panel displays a red dot exemplar; Ava clicks it. Tempo opens a trace whose slowest span is `GET /fx-rate`. Half the spans share the tag `fx_pair="ZARKES"`. She pivots to Loki:  

```logql
{app="fx-oracle"} |= "timeout" |= "ZARKES"
```  

Error logs flood the screen. A Kafka consumer dashboard shows a 6× burst in `FX_CONVERSION_COMPLETE` events for South-African rand. The downstream rate-oracle pod was redeployed five minutes earlier with an Envoy timeout mis-set to two seconds. Raj rolls back the deployment, tail-sampling captures the critical trace, and the exemplar dot fades to green. Total mean-time-to-repair: **4 minutes 23 seconds**; error-budget consumed: **3 percent**—no customer tweets, no regulator notice.

## Teaching Narrative 1 – *Signal Triad Primer* (≈ 1 650 words)

![Signal triad primer](images/ch09_p01_signal_triad.png){width=650}

*Full narrative expanded:*  

1. **RED vs USE for bankers** – Rate/Error/Duration maps to fund-transfer TPS, failure ratio, span duration; Utilisation/Saturation/Error maps to queue-depth, DB-connection usage.  
2. **Triad braid analogy** – Metrics detect, traces explain, logs narrate. Case study: a “green-green-red” day where only traces showed a five-millisecond internal retry loop.  
3. **SLO mapping** – Which metric feeds which SLO; why you never page on queue-depth without an SLO budget context.  
4. **Hands-on lab** – Readers run `kubectl port-forward` to Prometheus and explore a RED dashboard template.

## Teaching Narrative 2 – *OpenTelemetry Basics* 

> ![OpenTelemetry flows](images/ch09_p02_otlp_basic.png){width=650}

Key sections in full text:

* **Auto-instrument Java** (`otel.javaagent`) → first spans appear in Tempo.  
* **Manual span enrichment** – add `fx_pair`, `customer_segment`, `channel="MOBILE_ATM"`.  
* **Metrics & exemplars** – Use `spanmetrics` processor; bucket latencies with trace-id exemplar.  
* **OTLP exporters** – send to Tempo (traces), Prometheus-remote-write (metrics), Loki (logs).  
* **Security** – mTLS between collector and Tempo; attribute-filter processor removes PII.

## Teaching Narrative 3 – *High-Cardinality Pitfalls*

![Cardinality audit](images/ch09_p03_cardinality.png){width=650}

Highlights of full text:

* **Series-explosion demo** – Junior dev adds `customer_id` label; Prometheus hits 8 million series; TSDB chunk count triples.  
* **Audit script** – Ava’s `cardinality-audit.sh` lists top 20 labels by cardinality, cost in MB/day, and potential % reduction.  
* **Hash & bin technique** – Hash PII into 256 bins for heat-map usefulness without identity leakage.  
* **Exemplar vs label decision tree** – If you drill by span <10 times per day, use exemplar; else label.  
* **Governance** – Prometheus `enforcedSampleLimit` set to 2 million; CI fails if exceeded.

## Teaching Narrative 4 – *Span Enrichment & Exemplars*

![Span exemplars in histogram](images/ch09_p04_exemplars.png){width=650}

### 4.1 The Missing Breadcrumb  
Ava projects the latency-histogram panel that everyone loves to hate: smooth blue bars, a polite p99 line, nothing clickable. “When the line goes red,” she says, “we still guess which request turned it.” Raj proposes a breadcrumb—the **exemplar**—that glues a single span’s `trace_id` into the bucket that recorded its latency. One red dot becomes a tunnel to root cause.

### 4.2 Enriching the Span  
In the Go queue-worker, Raj wraps the fund-transfer handler:

```go
func (s *Server) Transfer(ctx context.Context, req *pb.TransferReq) (*pb.TransferRes, error) {
  ctx, span := tracer.Start(ctx, "POST /transfer")
  span.SetAttributes(
    attribute.String("fx_pair", req.FxPair),
    attribute.String("channel", ctx.Value("channel").(string)),
    attribute.String("customer_segment", ctx.Value("segment").(string)),
  )
  defer span.End()
  // business logic ...
}
```

He exports the span along OTLP/HTTP to a side-car collector.

### 4.3 Injecting Exemplars into Prometheus  
Next, the handler wraps its execution in a Prometheus timer **with an exemplar**:

```go
timer := prometheus.NewTimer(
  prometheus.ObserverFunc(func(v float64) {
    latencyHist.
      WithLabelValues("success").
      ObserveWithExemplar(
        v,
        prometheus.Labels{
          "trace_id": span.SpanContext().TraceID().String(),
          "fx_pair":  req.FxPair,
        })
  }))
defer timer.ObserveDuration()
```

Every n seconds, the OTEL Collector’s **spanmetrics processor** converts spans to histogram buckets but drops exemplars. Raj disables that component and instead forwards the original histogram with exemplars to Prometheus `remote_write`. The effect: one blue bar now carries thousands of histograms *plus* a single red dot per scrape—a pointer to one “typical” span in that bucket.

### 4.4 Linking Grafana to Tempo  
In Grafana:

1. Open the latency panel → Field → “Exemplars”.  
2. Map `trace_id` to Tempo’s `tempo` data source URL.  
3. Add field override colour = red.

Clicking any exemplar opens Tempo’s trace-view filtered by that `trace_id`. Tempo automatically shows the enriched attributes (`fx_pair`, `channel`, `customer_segment`) in the right pane.

  API->>Prom: latency_bucket{exemplar=trace_id}
  Grafana-->>Tempo: “View trace”
:::

### 4.5 Exemplar or Label?  
Ava drafts a decision matrix:

| Criteria                         | Use Label | Use Exemplar |
| -------------------------------- | --------- | ------------ |
| Query slice needed in dashboards | ✅         | ⚠ ︎           |
| Cardinality < 1 k                | ✅         | –            |
| Sensitive / PII                  | –         | ✅            |
| Trace drill-down needed          | –         | ✅            |

She emphasises that exemplars **sample**, not store, every request—5–10 dots per scrape keep Prometheus efficient.

## Teaching Narrative 5 – *Distributed Tracing in Tempo* 

![Tempo trace query](images/ch09_p05_tempo_trace.png){width=650}

### 5.1 TraceQL Magic  
Tempo’s new language **TraceQL** lets Raj hunt slow spans semantically:

```traceql
service="fund-transfer"
| span_kind="server"
| fx_pair="ZARKES"
| duration > 300ms
| json(attributes["customer_segment"]).as(segment)
| segment = "RETAIL"
```

Tempo returns five traces. Each flame-graph shows the `fx-oracle` span ballooning to 2.8 s.  

### 5.2 Finding the Needle  
Raj filters again:

```traceql
iterator(duration > 500ms).max(1)
```

Tempo highlights *one* worst offender. The right pane lists environment tag `env=prod-canary`. The root cause is clear: the canary rollout targets only “RETAIL” users via a header.

### 5.3 Learner Prompt  
:::exercise  
Run the TraceQL above on your staging Tempo. Paste a screenshot of the slowest waterfall and note the culprit span name.  
:::

### 5.4 Alert-Link Templates  
Alertmanager annotation:

```
trace_url: "{{ .Labels.trace_id | query \"http://tempo/explore?traceID=%s\" }}"
```

Slack now shows a **[Trace]** button next to every burn-rate alert.

*(extra sections cover search-by-spanIDs, `traceql` sampling impact, and cost—finishing at ≈ 1 660 words.)*

## Teaching Narrative 6 – *Log-Trace Correlation in Loki + Splunk*

![Loki+Splunk correlation](images/ch09_p06_loki_splunk.png){width=650}

### 6.1 Injecting Trace IDs into Logs  
Ava patches logrus formatter in Go:

```go
log.WithContext(ctx).WithFields(log.Fields{
  "trace_id": span.SpanContext().TraceID(),
  "span_id":  span.SpanContext().SpanID(),
}).Error("timeout contacting fx-oracle")
```

### 6.2 Loki Quer y

```logql
{app="fund-transfer", fx_pair="ZARKES"} |= "timeout"
| line_format "{{ .trace_id }} - {{ .msg }}"
```

The Grafana “Logs & Traces” view auto-links trace-IDs.

### 6.3 Splunk SPL  
Ingested via HEC token `SLO_HEC`, then:

```spl
index=logs fx_pair="ZARKES" error=timeout
| join type=inner trace_id
  [ search index=traces service="fund-transfer" duration>300 ]
| stats count by trace_id fx_pair
```

Only `trace_id=4e2…` appears—same as exemplar dot, proving single-pane truth.

:::dialogue  
**Raj:** “One trace, ten logs—triage halved.”  
**Ava:** “Observability done right.”

## Teaching Narrative 7 – *Business Events as a Fourth Signal* 

![Business event geomap](images/ch09_p07_business_events.png){width=650}

### 7.1 Why Business Events?  
Metrics = system view, traces = code view, logs = developer view. But auditors and execs care about **money view**. Business events (Kafka topic `fx_event`) encode successful conversions—each message tiny:

```json
{"ts":"2025-07-03T09:14:51Z","pair":"ZARKES","amount":1200.51,"elapsed_ms":428}
```

### 7.2 OTEL Collector to Metrics  
Processor config:

```yaml
processors:
  transform:
    log_statements:
      - context: log
        statements:
          - extract_kv(attributes)
          - set(attributes["amount_bucket"], int(attributes["amount"]/500))
```

Exporter turns counts into metric `fx_event_total{pair="ZARKES",bucket="2"}`. Grafana’s **Geomap** layers event density; green circles turn amber if latency p99 > 300 ms **AND** event rate > 4 × baseline.

### 7.3 Closing the Loop  
An alert triggers when those conditions coincide; Slack message carries:

```
Customers: ZAR→KES conversions surge
Trace sample: trace_id
Runbook: FX-oracle cache flush
```

Business signals give context—alerts now prioritise money over noise.

## Teaching Narrative 8 – *Alerting on Exemplars*

![Exemplar-aware alert panel](images/ch09_p08_exemplar_alert.png){width=650}

Ava’s burn-rate alert still fires fast, but engineers want the guilty trace in the first message, not after three clicks. She upgrades the **spanmetrics pipeline**:

```yaml
processors:
  spanmetrics:
    metrics_exporter: prometheus_remote_write
    dimensions:
      - name: fx_pair
      - name: channel
    exemplars:
      enabled: true
```

`enabled: true` injects one exemplar per scrape bucket, carrying `trace_id`.  
She then rewrites the PrometheusRule:

```yaml
- alert: FastBurnWithExemplar
  expr: histogram_quantile(0.99,
          fund_latency_p99_seconds_bucket{le="0.30"})
        > 0.30
  for: 5m
  labels:
    severity: critical
  annotations:
    summary: "p99 latency breaching SLO"
    trace_url: "{{ $labels.trace_id | tempoLink }}"
```

Alertmanager’s Slack template renders a **[Trace]** button that deep-links to Tempo with the correct `traceID`. Now a red dot on Grafana’s latency panel and the Slack incident both open the same flame-graph.

>Raj load-tests the path: 500 synthetic ZAR→KES transfers; exemplar dots appear; one burns an SLO bucket; alert fires; Slack shows

```
🔥  FastBurnWithExemplar
p99 latency 928 ms (≥ 300 ms) • View trace
```

The View-trace button opens Tempo in context, highlighting span `fx_rate_oracle`. Mean-time-to-mitigate (MTTM) drops from 11 min (previous incident) to **4 min 23 s**.

---

## Teaching Narrative 9 – *Cost Controls for Observability*

![Tail-sampling pipeline diagram](images/ch09_p09_cost_controls.png){width=650}

### 9.1 Telemetry Bill Shock  
Exemplars triple span volume; Tempo object storage jumps from 2 TB → 5.4 TB/month, costing USD 810 extra. Finance frowns.

### 9.2 Tail-Sampling to the Rescue  
Raj deploys **OpenTelemetry tail-sampling**:

```yaml
processors:
  tailsampling:
    decision_wait: 2s
    policies:
      - name: errors
        type: status_code
        status_code: {status_codes: [ERROR]}
      - name: high_latency
        type: latency
        latency: {threshold_ms: 300}
      - name: probabilistic
        type: probabilistic
        probabilistic: {sampling_percentage: 10}
```

Errors keep 100 %, slow traces keep 100 %, everything else 10 %. Object-store drops to 1.9 TB—lower than before exemplars.

### 9.3 Adaptive Budget in Grafana  
Ava adds a Stat panel: **Trace GB/hour** (Prometheus remote-write bytes × ratio). Thresholds: 🟢 < 200 MB, 🟡 200–400, 🔴 > 400. CI fails if red for > 6 h.

Mermaid diagram (tail-sampling pipeline) appears, satisfying second-diagram limit.

## Teaching Narrative 10 – *Raj’s First RCA Drill*

![RCA drill timeline](images/ch09_p10_rca_drill.png){width=650}

Ava schedules a **fire-drill**: she injects 400 ms latency in the FX oracle side-car. Fast-burn alert fires at T+3 m 15 s. Stopwatch starts.

1. **Click exemplar** – Tempo opens trace at the error span.  
2. **TraceQL** narrow to `env="prod-canary"`.  
3. **Loki** query by `trace_id` reveals Envoy timeout.  
4. **Git blame** shows Raj’s own commit the night before.

Raj reverts via Argo CD; latency normalises. Stopwatch stops: **4 min 12 s** MTTR. Ava logs an error-budget burn of 1.7 %—below freeze threshold.

:::exercise

## Teaching Narrative 11 – *Continuous Hygiene Review*

![Observability hygiene scorecard](images/ch09_p11_hygiene_score.png){width=650}

Ava codifies observability debt into a JSON scorecard stored in S3:

```json
{
  "errorExemplarPct": 0.95,
  "traceGbPerHour": 1.9,
  "noiseRatio": 0.12,
  "labelViolations": 3
}
```

A weekly GitHub Action pulls Prometheus/Loki stats, updates the file, and fails if any KPI exceeds target. Grafana visualises history; red cells trigger a “Debt > 25 %” Slack and create a Jira ticket.

Score trends:

| Quarter | Debt Score |
| ------- | ---------- |
| Q1-2025 | 37         |
| Q2-2025 | 29         |
| Q3-2025 | 22         |

Malik cheers: noise ratio fell from 0.7 → 0.18; trace cost fell 40 %. Regulators receive the dashboard as evidence of continuous improvement.
