*Let me stop you right there*—before we mint new slogans, we need to know which gauges already read “green.” I scanned the 20-item list in **ava_kimani_qoutes_catch-phrases.md** and grouped them by the message they reinforce :

| Theme | Existing Zingers |
|-------|------------------|
| **Measurement over bragging** | 1, 2, 6, 12, 20 |
| **Error-budget wisdom** | 4, 10 |
| **User-centric focus** | 3, 5, 11, 15 |
| **Percentiles > averages** | 8 |
| **Databases & blame** | 9 |
| **Alert/monitoring hygiene** | 14 |
| **Cultural reminders** | 7, 13, 16 |
| **Testing & backups** | 17, 18 |
| **Ambitious-but-achievable goals** | 19 |

### Observations

1. **Great coverage on vanity-metric smack-downs**—five quips already hammer that nail.
2. **Sparse on automation/self-healing**—only an indirect nod via testing/backup.
3. **Nothing about incident post-mortems or learning loops**—a gap worth filling.
4. **One-off quips (percentiles, database guilt) land well** but could use sister lines to keep them fresh.

### Fresh catch-phrases to plug the gaps

I’ve drafted eight new lines in the same *warm-but-firm* tone. Use them when the existing list feels repetitive:

1. **Self-healing / automation**  
   > “If your script can fix it in 30 seconds, why are you still paging humans at 3 a.m.?”

2. **Post-mortem culture**  
   > “A blame-free RCA isn’t a hug-circle—it’s a magnifying glass on the process, not the person.”

3. **Learning loops**  
   > “Every outage paid tuition—did you cash in the lesson or toss it in the shredder?”

4. **Runbooks**  
   > “Runbooks should read like a recipe, not a riddle. If step two is ‘figure it out,’ start over.”

5. **Automation SLOs**  
   > “Your bots need targets too—an unrehearsed rollback is just a faster way to fail.”

6. **Capacity realism**  
   > “Hope is not a load-test. Hammer the system before users hammer you.”

7. **Observability debt**  
   > “Logs you never read are storage-tax, not insight. Rotate or renovate.”

8. **Incident drills**  
   > “If chaos day scares you, production night will terrify you. Better to sweat in practice.”

### Usage tips

* **Rotate, don’t spam**—pick two or three that fit the lesson. Repetition dulls the edge.  
* **Tailor to stage**—beginner sessions benefit from the measurement lines; advanced workshops love the automation quips.  
* **Pair with visuals**—attach a small icon (e.g., ⚙️ for automation) in slides so learners subconsciously tag the takeaway.  
* **End-cap slides**—close a module with a catch-phrase plus one action item (“Measure p95 this sprint—or keep guessing”).  
* **Merch potential**—phrases 1, 4, 10, and 20 are mug-worthy; print them on swag to reinforce culture.

*Tuko pamoja*—we’re in this together. Keep the quotes sharp, relevant, and, above all, **measurable** in the impact they have on your learners’ habits.
