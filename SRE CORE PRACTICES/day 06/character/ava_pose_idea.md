Scenario | Visual twist
Calling out vanity metrics | Ava leaning forward, one eyebrow raised, finger gently tapping a 99.999 % figure on a dashboard; wrist-slap motion cue.
Teaching moment | Half-smile, glasses perched low, writing an SLO equation on a portable whiteboard; wooden bangle visible.
On-call action | Sleeves rolled, sneakers on, smartwatch glowing; dreadlocks tied back in a loose bun for focus.
Cultural analogy | Holding a coffee mug that reads “Reliability you can measure” while pointing to a Kitenge-pattern diagram overlay.
