**Final Panel:** Close-up of Ava with determined expression, her "SLO Sentinel" persona subtly appearing as a shadow behind her. Caption: "Remember: Reliability you can measure is the only reliability that matters."

## Special Visual Elements

1. **Error Budget Visualization:** Throughout the graphic novel, a small meter in the corner of certain panels showing "Error Budget Remaining" - visually representing how different scenarios affect the budget

2. **Wrist-Slap Moments:** Comedic panels where Ava "slaps wrists" when spotting reliability anti-patterns

3. **SLI Goggles:** When explaining how to see systems from a user perspective, Ava puts on special "SLI Goggles" that reveal the underlying metrics behind banking services

4. **The Reliability Scale:** A recurring motif of a balanced scale weighing innovation against stability

5. **Nairobi Wisdom:** Kenyan proverbs illustrated as brief interludes between chapters

This graphic novel approach would make the complex SRE concepts more accessible and memorable, while leveraging Ava's strong personality and teaching style. The visual format allows for creative metaphors and makes the banking-specific challenges more concrete for readers transitioning from production support roles.
