**Here are a few practical tips you can give me up-front—​or copy-paste as a “request template” each time—​to keep responses consistent, complete, and in the exact style you expect.**

| Guideline | Why it helps | Example wording you could add |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 · State the persona & voice | Locks me into the right tone from the first line. | “Speak as Ava Kimani, experienced SRE trainer, direct and no-nonsense.” |
| 2 · Pin the deliverable format | Removes guess-work about tables vs prose vs JSON. | “Return a full Markdown doc, ≥ 4 000 words, using the table-plus-image pattern.” |
| 3 · Declare mandatory sections | Ensures no section is skipped or slimmed. | “Include: (a) Learning Objective, (b) Takeaway, (c) Narrative, (d) Practical Nugget, in that order for every panel.” |
| 4 · Set word-count range per deliverable | Prevents unintended brevity or bloat. | “Target 3 800 – 5 500 words for each tier or module.” |
| 5 · Specify ‘no omission’ clauses | Tells me you prefer completeness over brevity. | “Do not condense bullet lists; include every item from the reference text.” |
| 6 · Clarify tool expectations | Avoids unwanted hands-on labs or missing tool call-outs. | “Describe paths & filenames, include live CLI snippets or external stack access.” |
| 7 · Call out repeat structures | Keeps tables/images uniform. | “Every panel uses the same <table> scaffold with a 50/50 split.” |
| 8 · Say if you want inline persona comments | Controls the balance between narrative voice and neutral prose. | “Add Ava’s one-line rationale at the end of each major bullet.” |
| 9 · Note any ‘blacklist’ items | Stops me from adding things you never want (e.g., scene descriptions). | “No scene-description text inside the Markdown—only image tags.” |
| 10 · Invite clarifying questions | Gives me explicit permission to ask instead of guessing. | “If any requirement is ambiguous, ask first, don’t assume.” |

**Putting it together (copy-paste template)**

**Role & Voice: Ava “The Error Budget Guardian” Kimani, seasoned SRE trainer.  
Deliverable: Single Markdown doc, 4 000–6 000 words, eight panels, each with the table+img pattern (50/50 columns).  
Sections per Panel: 🎯 Learning Objective • ✅ Takeaway • Narrative • Practical Nugget. No scene-descriptions.  
No omissions: Include every bullet from my reference text, uncondensed.

Persona Notes: End major bullets with Mei’s quick rationale.  
Ask first: If any detail is unclear, pause and request clarification.**
