## Color Palette

I'd suggest a combination of:

1. **Primary Colors**:
   - Deep Indigo Blue (#2D3E50) - Representing reliability, professionalism, and the banking sector
   - Vibrant Orange (#E67E22) - Drawing from Kenyan textiles and representing innovation
   - Teal (#1ABC9C) - For metrics, graphs, and technical elements

2. **Supporting Colors**:
   - Warm Gray (#95A5A6) - For backgrounds and secondary elements
   - Soft White (#ECF0F1) - For text backgrounds
   - Accent Red (#E74C3C) - For alerts, error budgets, and warning states

This palette offers professional credibility while incorporating vibrant elements that reflect Ava's personality and Kenyan heritage.

## Line Style & Art Direction

For the illustration style, I recommend:

1. **Line Work**: 
   - Clean, medium-weight lines with selective detail
   - Semi-realistic facial expressions and body language (not overly cartoonish)
   - Slightly stylized proportions to allow for expressiveness

2. **Technical Elements**:
   - Crisp, precise representation of dashboards, metrics, and technical diagrams
   - Data visualizations using simple but elegant line graphs, histograms, and gauges
   - Clean iconography for technical concepts

3. **Environment & Setting**:
   - Modern tech environments with subtle African architectural elements
   - Nairobi skyline featuring recognizable landmarks
   - Banking environments that mix traditional elements with modern tech

4. **Character Design**:
   - Ava should have consistent, recognizable features across all illustrations
   - Professional yet distinctive clothing with subtle Kenyan-inspired patterns
   - Expressive hands and face to convey her teaching passion
   - The "SLO Sentinel" superhero elements should be subtle, perhaps appearing as reflections or shadows

## Layout Approach

For the hybrid text/illustration format:

1. **Panel Flow**: 
   - Use 2-4 panels per concept sequence for clarity
   - Maintain consistent reading direction (left-to-right, top-to-bottom)
   - Use larger, impactful single panels for major concept introductions

2. **Text Integration**:
   - Clear separation between prose sections and illustrated sections
   - Speech bubbles with distinctive styling for Ava's direct quotes
   - Technical terms highlighted consistently throughout

3. **Visual Metaphors**:
   - Consistent visual language for concepts (e.g., error budgets always shown as actual budgets or resources)
   - Banking metaphors that translate technical concepts into financial terms
   - Clear visual distinction between "theory" sections and "practical application" sections

This approach creates a distinctive, professional look that's approachable without being childish, technically accurate without being dry, and culturally relevant without relying on stereotypes.

For reference, the style could be inspired by educational graphic novels like "Understanding Comics" by Scott McCloud or "Economix" by Michael Goodwin, but with a more modern tech aesthetic and Kenyan-influenced design elements.
