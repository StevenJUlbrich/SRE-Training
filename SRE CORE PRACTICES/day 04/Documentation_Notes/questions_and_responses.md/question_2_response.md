# Defining Traces and Distributed Tracing for Banking SRE Training

Let me help define the scope, core principles, and banking context for our Traces and Distributed Tracing training materials.

## 1. Scope and Boundaries of Traces and Distributed Tracing

### Scope:
- Traces as a fundamental observability pillar alongside logs and metrics
- Distributed tracing as a technique for tracking requests across multiple services
- Evolution from monolithic to microservices monitoring
- Trace collection, sampling, visualization, and analysis
- Correlation between traces, logs, and metrics
- Trace-based alerting and anomaly detection
- OpenTelemetry and other industry standards

### Boundaries:
- Focus on application-level tracing rather than network-level packet tracing
- Emphasis on service interactions rather than infrastructure monitoring
- Concentrate on production environments over development/testing phases
- Include enough metrics and logging context without duplicating those topics
- Cover implementation aspects without deep-diving into vendor-specific solutions

## 2. Core Principles and Concepts to Cover

### Foundational Concepts:
- What is a trace and span in distributed systems
- Context propagation and trace continuity
- Sampling strategies and trade-offs
- Trace visualization and interpretation
- Root cause analysis using traces
- Correlation IDs and trace headers

### Intermediate Concepts:
- Service dependency mapping through traces
- Performance bottleneck identification
- Error rate and latency analysis
- Trace-based SLI definition and measurement
- Anomaly detection in trace patterns
- Implementing effective sampling strategies

### Advanced Concepts:
- Probabilistic and adaptive sampling techniques
- Custom attribute enrichment
- Business transaction tracing
- Trace-driven capacity planning
- Trace data retention strategies
- Multi-environment trace correlation

## 3. Banking/Financial Services Context

### Industry-Specific Applications:
- Payment processing systems with multiple clearing pathways
- Trading platforms with order execution flows
- Customer account management journeys
- Fraud detection and prevention pipelines
- Regulatory compliance and audit trails
- Cross-border transaction processing

### Banking-Specific Challenges:
- High-value transaction tracing requirements
- Regulatory requirements for transaction traceability
- Reconciliation processes between systems
- Batch processing and real-time hybrid architectures
- Third-party integration monitoring
- Legacy system integration with modern tracing frameworks

### Financial Impact Areas:
- Transaction latency impact on customer experience
- Cost of failed transactions due to timeout cascades
- Regulatory penalties for processing errors
- Operational efficiency in problem detection and resolution
- Risk management through early anomaly detection
- Customer retention through improved reliability

This definition provides a structured foundation for developing our SRE training materials, balancing technical depth with practical application in the banking domain. It maintains the 85/15 balance between SRE technical content and banking-specific context while ensuring relevance for professionals transitioning from production support roles.
