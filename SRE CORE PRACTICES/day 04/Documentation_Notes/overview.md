# Process for Creating SRE Training Material

## 1. Framework and Template Development
- Created a structured chapter layout template (chapter_layout.md) with consistent sections:
  - Panel title and scene description (visual element)
  - Teaching narrative (core concept explanation)
  - Common example of the problem (real-world scenario)
  - SRE best practice with evidence-based investigation (solution approach)
  - Banking impact (business relevance)
  - Implementation guidance (practical steps)

## 2. Topic Selection and Chapter Organization
- Identified core SRE concepts relevant to financial services
- Organized topics into logical chapters following a progression from fundamentals to advanced concepts
- Maintained 85% focus on SRE metrics with 15% narrative elements for context
- Ensured topics directly addressed the challenges faced when transitioning from production support to SRE

## 3. Content Development Approach
- Used scenario-based teaching with practical examples from banking environments
- Created "common example" scenarios based on realistic industry challenges
- Developed comprehensive "SRE best practice" sections using evidence-based approaches
- Connected technical concepts to business impact, emphasizing the "why" behind each practice
- Provided concrete implementation guidance at each stage

## 4. Domain-Specific Application
- Applied general SRE principles to financial services contexts
- Incorporated banking-specific examples: payment processing, trading platforms, fraud detection
- Highlighted regulatory and compliance considerations unique to financial services
- Connected reliability metrics to financial impact and customer experience

## 5. Career Transition Focus
- Emphasized skill development needed when moving from reactive support to proactive reliability
- Connected traditional monitoring concepts to advanced SRE approaches
- Provided practical exercises and hands-on learning opportunities
- Built progressive complexity throughout chapters to guide skill development

## 6. Knowledge Scaffolding
- Started with fundamental concepts (basic metrics, traditional monitoring)
- Progressively introduced more complex topics (SLIs/SLOs, error budgets, chaos engineering)
- Concluded with advanced and emerging topics for continued growth
- Maintained consistent terminology and frameworks across chapters

## 7. Visual Learning Integration
- Incorporated scene descriptions that visualize concepts in action
- Used dashboards, workflows, and team interactions to illustrate abstract concepts
- Ensured visual elements reinforced key learning points
- Created mental models through descriptive visualization

## 8. Practical Application Emphasis
- Focused on real-world implementation rather than theory alone
- Provided specific, actionable implementation guidance
- Included metrics-based decision frameworks
- Connected concepts to daily operational activities

## Applying This Method to Other SRE Topics

To adapt this approach for other SRE training material:

1. **Identify Core Concepts**: Determine the essential SRE principles for your specific domain

2. **Create Domain-Specific Examples**: Develop realistic scenarios relevant to your industry (healthcare, retail, manufacturing, etc.)

3. **Maintain Consistent Structure**: Use the same chapter and panel format for cognitive scaffolding

4. **Focus on Career Transition Needs**: Address specific challenges when moving from production support to SRE

5. **Connect Technical to Business**: Always tie reliability metrics to business outcomes in your industry

6. **Progressive Complexity**: Build from fundamental to advanced topics in a logical sequence

7. **Practical Exercises**: Include hands-on components to develop applied skills

8. **Industry-Specific Considerations**: Highlight unique aspects of your domain (regulations, customer expectations, etc.)

This methodology creates comprehensive training material that balances technical depth with practical applicability, making it particularly effective for professionals transitioning into SRE roles from traditional operations backgrounds.
