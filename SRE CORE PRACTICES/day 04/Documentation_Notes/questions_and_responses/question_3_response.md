# SRE Training: Traces and Distributed Tracing Curriculum Outline

## Chapter 1: From Monitoring to Observability - The Evolution of System Visibility
An introduction to the three pillars of observability (logs, metrics, and traces) and how they differ from traditional monitoring approaches. Explores why production support professionals need to shift from reactive alerting to proactive observability, with special focus on the limitations of traditional banking monitoring tools.

## Chapter 2: Traces Fundamentals - Understanding Request Flows
Introduces the basic concepts of traces, spans, and context propagation in distributed systems. Explains how traces capture the journey of requests across multiple services in banking applications and why this visibility is crucial for modern financial architectures.

## Chapter 3: The Anatomy of a Trace - Spans, Tags, and Events
Detailed breakdown of trace components including parent-child relationships, span attributes, and semantic conventions. Demonstrates how to read and interpret trace data to understand system behavior in critical banking workflows like payment processing.

## Chapter 4: Distributed Tracing in Microservice Architectures
Explores the challenges of tracking requests across service boundaries in modern banking platforms. Covers context propagation techniques and demonstrates how distributed tracing solves the visibility challenges created by microservice adoption in financial systems.

## Chapter 5: Implementing Tracing - Instrumentation Approaches
Practical guide to adding tracing to existing applications through manual, automatic, and library-based instrumentation. Focuses on approaches for gradually introducing tracing to banking systems without disrupting critical operations or requiring complete rewrites.

## Chapter 6: Sampling Strategies - Balancing Coverage and Performance
Examines trace sampling approaches from head-based to tail-based sampling, with consideration for high-value transaction visibility. Addresses the specific concerns of financial services where certain transactions must always be traced for regulatory compliance while managing data volume.

## Chapter 7: OpenTelemetry and Industry Standards
Overview of the OpenTelemetry ecosystem and how it standardizes observability data collection. Explores integration patterns for banking environments with mixed legacy and modern systems, and strategies for adopting industry standards.

## Chapter 8: Trace Visualization and Exploration
Techniques for effective trace visualization, search, and exploration to identify patterns and anomalies. Demonstrates practical approaches to investigating latency issues in critical banking operations using trace data and visualization tools.

## Chapter 9: Root Cause Analysis with Distributed Tracing
Methods for using trace data to quickly identify the source of production issues. Applies trace-driven troubleshooting to common banking scenarios like failed transactions, reconciliation errors, and third-party integration problems.

## Chapter 10: Building Service Maps from Trace Data
How to leverage trace information to automatically generate and maintain accurate service dependency maps. Explores techniques for visualizing the complex interactions between banking services to improve system understanding and change management.

## Chapter 11: Performance Optimization Through Trace Analysis
Advanced techniques for identifying bottlenecks, inefficient patterns, and optimization opportunities using trace data. Demonstrates how systematic trace analysis can improve transaction throughput and reduce latency in high-volume banking operations.

## Chapter 12: Trace-Based Service Level Indicators (SLIs)
Framework for defining meaningful SLIs based on trace data that align with customer experience. Covers approaches for measuring critical banking user journeys like account opening, loan applications, and trading operations using trace-derived metrics.

## Chapter 13: Anomaly Detection and Alerting with Trace Patterns
Strategies for implementing trace-based anomaly detection to identify unusual behavior before it impacts customers. Explores automated pattern recognition in traces to detect potential fraud, system degradation, or security issues in banking systems.

## Chapter 14: Integrating Traces with Logs and Metrics
Methods for correlating all three observability signals to gain comprehensive system understanding. Demonstrates unified troubleshooting approaches that combine trace context with logs and metrics to solve complex banking system issues faster.

## Chapter 15: Advanced Use Cases - Business Transaction Tracing
Extending technical tracing to capture business-level events and decision points. Shows how to implement transaction tracing that follows the complete lifecycle of financial transactions from initiation through clearing, settlement, and reconciliation.

This curriculum provides a structured learning path that progressively builds knowledge while maintaining strong connections to banking-specific challenges and use cases. Each chapter addresses practical skills needed by production support professionals transitioning to SRE roles in financial services.
