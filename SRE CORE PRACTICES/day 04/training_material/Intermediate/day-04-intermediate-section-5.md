# 🗄️ Log Storage & Retention Policies

*Intermediate SRE Logging Module: Balancing Access, Cost, and Compliance*

*With Johan—because keeping everything forever isn’t observability, it’s hoarding.*

---

> **Johan's Thought:**
> *"You don’t need every log forever. You need the right logs, at the right time, in the right place."*

---

## 🧭 Module Purpose

This module will teach you how to:
- Design a log storage strategy based on value and use case
- Define retention periods that meet operational, financial, and regulatory needs
- Tier your storage for cost-effective retrieval
- Apply practical cleanup, archiving, and deletion policies

---

## 📦 Why Storage Strategy Matters

Without a strategy, logs accumulate endlessly. This leads to:
- 🌩️ **Ballooning storage costs**
- 🧭 **Slower search/query performance**
- ⚠️ **Increased security and compliance risk**

A smart SRE logs with purpose—and stores with a plan.

## 🔑 Types of Log Data (by Use Case)

| Type | Description | Retention Target |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| **Operational Logs** | App errors, stack traces, service logs | 7–30 days |
| **Security Logs** | Auth failures, firewalls, access logs | 30–90+ days (or compliance-specific) |
| **Audit Logs** | User activity, changes, admin actions | 90–365+ days |
| **Debug/Verbose** | Low-value unless troubleshooting | 1–3 days (or sampled) |

> **Johan’s Prompt:**
> *“If your debug logs are eating 70% of your budget, they’re not helping—they’re hurting.”*

## 🧱 Retention Policies

### 🔹 What is a Retention Policy?
A set of rules that determine:
- How long logs are kept
- Where they are stored
- When they are deleted, moved, or archived

### 🧠 Common Retention Patterns:
- Errors: 30 days in hot storage
- Warnings: 14 days, auto-deleted
- Traces: 7 days hot, 30 days archive
- Audit logs: 1 year, immutable storage (e.g., S3 with WORM)

> **🧪 Practice Prompt:**
> Your platform logs `auth.log` at 1GB/day. Legal requires 6 months of retention. How much storage do you need?

✅ **Answer:** 1 GB/day × 180 days = **180 GB** minimum for raw storage (more with indexing, replication, backups)

## 📂 Hot, Warm, Cold, Frozen Tiers

Many platforms support **tiered log storage**:

| Tier | Use | Performance | Cost |
|------|-----|-------------|------|
| **Hot** | Real-time analysis, dashboards | Fastest | $$$ |
| **Warm** | Daily searches, recent incidents | Moderate | $$ |
| **Cold** | Rarely accessed, archive | Slow | $ |
| **Frozen** | Offline archive (S3, Glacier) | Manual/Batch access | ¢ |

> **Johan's Tip:**
> *“Hot is for ops, warm for audits, cold for ‘just in case’, and frozen for lawyers.”*

---

## 🧩 Implementation Examples

### 🔹 Splunk
- Use Index Lifecycle Management (ILM)
- Hot/warm/cold/frozen index tiers
- `frozenTimePeriodInSecs` to expire logs

### 🔹 Elasticsearch
- ILM policies move logs between nodes
- Roll over indices based on size/age

### 🔹 Loki + S3
- Logs stored in object storage
- Query range limited by config
- Long-term archiving via chunk expiration + rehydration

### 🔹 CloudWatch
- Retention set per log group (1 day to infinite)
- Export to S3 for archive

> **🧪 Practice Prompt:**
> Write a policy for retaining `security-events.log` for 90 days hot, then moving to Glacier for 1 year.

## 🔒 Security and Compliance Considerations

- 🔐 Encrypt log storage at rest (AES-256, customer-managed keys)
- 🧾 Use immutable storage (WORM) for audit logs
- 📜 Meet regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS)
- 🧹 Purge expired logs automatically to reduce risk

> **Scenario:**
> Your logs contain user emails. GDPR requires deletion within 30 days of user account removal. How would you automate this?

✅ **Answer:** Tag logs with `user_id`, use retention rules + API to purge logs when deletion requests occur.

## 📘 Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Retention Policy** | A rule for how long to store logs |
| **Tiered Storage** | Storing logs in layers by cost/speed |
| **WORM** | Write Once, Read Many (immutable storage) |
| **ILM** | Index Lifecycle Management (e.g., in Splunk, ES) |
| **Hot/Warm/Cold/Frozen** | Storage tiers based on access frequency |

---

> **Johan’s Final Thought:**
> *“Your logs aren’t immortal. Treat them like your time: store wisely, delete responsibly.”*
