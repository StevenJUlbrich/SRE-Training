## 🧠 **DALL·E Prompt for Johan Teaching Traces**

> **“Modern comic book style illustration of Johan, a senior SRE instructor from Stockholm, standing in front of a glowing dashboard visualizing distributed traces. He has short, neat dirty blond hair, sharp blue eyes, rectangular glasses, and a smart-casual outfit—a charcoal sweater over a collared shirt. Behind him, a waterfall trace graph glows across the screen with labeled spans like ‘auth’, ‘checkout’, and ‘db query’. Johan gestures thoughtfully to the trace, emphasizing root cause detection. Caption: ‘Every trace tells a story—read it before it becomes a headline.’ Warm amber and muted navy tones with clean digital lines.”**
