### 8. Multiple Choice: Multiple-Table JOIN

```
## Question 8: Joining 3 Tables
üß© Intermediate

A. FROM Customers, Orders, Products WHERE ...
B. FROM Customers c JOIN Orders o, Products p
C. FROM Customers c JOIN Orders o ON c.id = o.id JOIN Products p ON o.pid = p.pid
D. FROM Customers c LEFT Customers d RIGHT Products p
```

### 9. Multiple Choice: JOIN Order Considerations

```
## Question 9: JOIN Order in Oracle
üß© Intermediate

Which of the following statements about join order in Oracle is TRUE?

A. The order of tables in the FROM clause has no effect on performance.
B. Oracle‚Äôs optimizer can reorder JOINs based on cost, but sometimes using hints can affect the chosen order.
C. Only the first two tables in the query can be reordered, subsequent tables remain fixed.
D. The order of tables is completely ignored by the optimizer.
```

### 10. Multiple Choice: RIGHT OUTER JOIN Scenario

```
## Question 10: RIGHT OUTER JOIN Usage
üß© Intermediate

You have two tables: `departments` (right side) and `employees` (left side). A RIGHT OUTER JOIN is used to:

A. Return all rows from employees, plus matched rows from departments
B. Return only matched rows in both employees and departments
C. Return all rows from departments, plus matched rows from employees
D. Return a cartesian product of employees and departments
```

### 11. Multiple Choice: Legacy ( + ) Syntax

```
## Question 11: Oracle (+) Syntax
üß© Intermediate

Which statement about the legacy `(+)` operator in Oracle is correct?

A. It can only be used for CROSS JOINs.
B. It can be placed on any column, including the SELECT list.
C. It is used in the WHERE clause to denote an outer join.
D. It indicates an INNER JOIN when used in the FROM clause.
```

### 12. True/False: Execution Plans

```
## Question 12: Viewing Execution Plans
üß© Intermediate

You can use `EXPLAIN PLAN` or `DBMS_XPLAN.DISPLAY` in Oracle to inspect the execution plan for a JOIN query.

A. True
B. False
```

### 13. Fill-in-the-Blank: Index Usage
