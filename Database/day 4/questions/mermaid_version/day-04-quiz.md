# **Day 4 Quiz**

## **(üîç) Beginner-Level Questions**

---

### **Question 1 (üîç, Multiple Choice)**
**Topic:** JOIN Basics / Case of the Missing Rows

Luis uncovered a ‚Äúmissing rows‚Äù mystery where an **INNER JOIN** caused data to vanish. Which statement best describes why rows may disappear in an INNER JOIN?

A. Inner joins exclude rows that lack a matching key in the other table  
B. Inner joins automatically generate extra NULL rows for unmatched data  
C. Inner joins fill columns with default values if a match is not found  
D. Inner joins dynamically create a CROSS product of all table rows  

---

### **Question 2 (üîç, True/False)**
**Topic:** INNER vs. LEFT JOIN

Luis says if your query discards rows without matching data, you might need a **LEFT JOIN** instead. True or false: A LEFT JOIN always excludes rows from the left table if there‚Äôs no match in the right table.

A. True  
B. False  

---

### **Question 3 (üîç, Multiple Choice)**
**Topic:** CROSS JOIN Footgun

According to Luis, the **CROSS JOIN** can be dangerous if used by accident. Why?

A. It merges only matching rows, hiding unmatched data  
B. It quickly becomes a Cartesian product, multiplying all rows from both tables  
C. It permanently locks both tables in exclusive mode  
D. It forbids the use of any WHERE clause  

---

### **Question 4 (üîç, Fill-in-the-Blank)**
**Topic:** Luis‚Äôs Rule #3

Complete the following statement about **FULL OUTER JOIN** from Luis‚Äôs detective handbook:

> ‚ÄúUse a FULL OUTER JOIN only if you truly need *all* rows from both sides, because it can produce ________ result sets if each table has many unmatched rows.‚Äù

A. unindexed  
B. minimal  
C. enormous  
D. partial  

---

### **Question 5 (üîç, Matching)**
**Topic:** JOIN Type Purposes

Match each JOIN type in Column A to Luis‚Äôs short description in Column B.

4. SELF JOIN  

Column B:  
A. Returns only the matching rows from both tables  
B. Retrieves all rows from both tables, matched or not

Luis explains Oracle‚Äôs older `(+)` operator for outer joins. Which statement best captures the difference compared to ANSI JOIN?

A. The `(+)` operator is for CROSS JOIN while ANSI is for LEFT/RIGHT/FULL  
B. `(+)` syntax places a plus sign next to columns in the WHERE clause to indicate an outer join  
C. `(+)` operator is always required for inner joins in Oracle  
D. `(+)` syntax is mandatory in modern Oracle for any join involving NULL rows  

---

### **Question 9 (üß©, Fill-in-the-Blank)**
**Topic:** Performance & Indexing

A. triggers  
B. constraints  
C. indexes  
D. foreign keys  

---

### **Question 10 (üß©, Matching)**
**Topic:** JOIN Suspects

Luis calls each JOIN a ‚Äúsuspect with a motive.‚Äù Match the description in Column A to the correct JOIN type in Column B.

Column A:  
1. Provides all rows from the right table, with NULL from the left if unmatched  
2. Potentially returns a cartesian product if no condition is given  
3. Let‚Äôs you combine a table with itself, referencing hierarchy or manager relationships  
4. Brings in rows only if both tables match on the joining column

Column B:  
A. CROSS JOIN  
B. SELF JOIN  
C. INNER JOIN  
D. RIGHT JOIN  

---

### **Question 11 (üß©, True/False)**
**Topic:** Multi-Table JOIN Logic

Luis warns that referencing three or more tables in a single statement can be tricky. True or false: If you use multiple JOINs in one query, you must place all the ON conditions in a single WHERE clause at the end, not near each JOIN.

A. True  
B. False  

---

### **Question 12 (üß©, Ordering with Diagram)**
**Topic:** Troubleshooting Missing Rows

Consider Luis‚Äôs flowchart on diagnosing missing rows:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["Suspect missing data in query"] --> B["Check if using INNER JOIN?"]
    B --> C{"Should unmatched rows appear?"}
    C -- Yes --> D["Switch to LEFT/RIGHT or FULL JOIN"]
    C -- No --> E["Review data integrity or partial dataset"]
    D --> F["Verify row counts now correct"]
```

Arrange these steps in the logical order for finding and fixing a missing row scenario:

A. Decide whether unmatched rows are actually needed  
B. See if the query is using an INNER JOIN  
C. If needed, switch to an outer join type  
D. Confirm row counts are correct after changes  

---

### **Question 13 (üß©, Multiple Choice)**
**Topic:** Oracle Execution Plans for JOINS

When Luis checks an execution plan using `EXPLAIN PLAN` on a multi-table JOIN, which operation typically indicates a **Cartesian** product or CROSS JOIN if no ON clause is specified?

A. `NESTED LOOPS`  
B. `HASH JOIN`  
C. `MERGE JOIN CARTESIAN`  
D. `INDEX RANGE SCAN`  

---

### **Question 14 (üß©, Multiple Choice with Diagram)**
**Topic:** Self JOIN Example

Examine the scenario below:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    Emp1["employee_id=101, manager_id=201"]
    Emp2["employee_id=201, manager_id=300"]
    Emp3["employee_id=300, manager_id=NULL (CEO)"]
```

Which SQL approach best captures a **SELF JOIN** to pair employees with their manager‚Äôs data?

A.  
```sql
SELECT e.name, m.name AS manager
FROM employees e
JOIN employees m
   ON e.manager_id = m.employee_id;
```

B.  
```sql
SELECT e.name, m.name AS manager
FROM employees e
FULL OUTER JOIN employees m
   ON e.employee_id = m.manager_id;
```

C.  
```sql
SELECT e.name, m.name AS manager
FROM employees e, employees m;
```

D.  
```sql
SELECT e.name
FROM employees e
WHERE e.manager_id = NULL;
```

---

### **Question 18 (üí°, Matching)**
**Topic:** JOIN Performance Hints

Match each scenario in Column A to the recommended approach in Column B, based on Luis‚Äôs SRE-level tips.

Column A:
1. Identical join columns have an index, but queries remain slow with large data sets  
2. The execution plan shows a suspicious `MERGE JOIN CARTESIAN` operation  
3. You see full table scans on 3+ joined tables with minimal filtering  
4. A CROSS JOIN is actually needed for a test data scenario

Column B:
A. Confirm all needed columns have indexes and consider query rewrites/hints  
B. Accept it if intended, but partition or limit data to avoid meltdown  
C. Possibly missing ON conditions or incomplete join logic  
D. Evaluate whether better filters or partial denormalization can reduce the dataset

B. session concurrency levels  
C. execution plan  
D. user privileges  

---

### **Question 20 (üí°, Ordering)**
**Topic:** Complex JOIN Troubleshooting Flow

Luis‚Äôs advanced approach for a multi-join slowdown typically follows these steps:
