## Mermaid Diagram Generation Guidelines

When creating Mermaid diagrams, follow these formatting rules to ensure proper rendering:

1. **Always Enclose Node Labels in Quotes**
   * If a node label has **parentheses** `( )`, **colons** `:`, or **HTML tags** like `<br/>`, wrap it in quotes:
   ```
   A["HASH JOIN (Outer)"]
   B["TABLE ACCESS FULL: CUSTOMERS"]
   C["Line1<br/>Line2"]
   ```

2. **Use Self-Closing `<br/>` Tags**
   * For line breaks in node labels, use `<br/>` (with a slash) instead of `<br>`.
   * Keep them inside quotes: `["Line1<br/>Line2"]`.

3. **Subgraph Titles**
   * Always wrap subgraph titles in quotes:
   ```
   subgraph "Customer Table"
     C1["ID: 1<br/>Name: Alice"]
   end
   ```

4. **Use Separate Lines for Each Arrow or Connection**
   * Place each connection on its own line:
   ```
   A --> B
   B --> C
   ```
   * Avoid: `A --> B --> C`

5. **No Raw Text Immediately After `subgraph`**
   * Add nodes for text inside subgraphs instead of raw text:
   ```
   subgraph "My Subgraph"
     N["Some text"]
   end
   ```

6. **Avoid Ambiguous Characters in the Flow**
   * Keep characters like `#`, `?`, or additional punctuation inside quotes if needed.

7. **Simplify Complex Diagrams**
   * Break down complex relationships into simpler sections.
   * Test diagrams incrementally to ensure proper rendering.

## Mermaid Diagram Specifications

For each diagram in the training module, follow these guidelines:

1. **JOIN Operation Diagrams**
   * Use Mermaid's flowchart syntax to show tables before and after JOIN operations
   * Include sample data to demonstrate the effects of different JOIN types
   * Use color coding to highlight matching records
   * Example:
   ```
   ```mermaid
   flowchart LR
     subgraph "Customer Table"
       C1["ID: 1<br/>Name: Alice"]
       C2["ID: 2<br/>Name: Bob"]
       C3["ID: 3<br/>Name: Carol"]
     end
     
     subgraph "Order Table"
       O1["ID: 101<br/>CustID: 1<br/>Amount: $50"]
       O2["ID: 102<br/>CustID: 1<br/>Amount: $25"]
       O3["ID: 103<br/>CustID: 2<br/>Amount: $100"]
     end
     
     subgraph "INNER JOIN Result"
       R1["CustID: 1<br/>Name: Alice<br/>OrderID: 101<br/>Amount: $50"]
       R2["CustID: 1<br/>Name: Alice<br/>OrderID: 102<br/>Amount: $25"]
       R3["CustID: 2<br/>Name: Bob<br/>OrderID: 103<br/>Amount: $100"]
     end
     
     C1 --> R1
     C1 --> R2
     C2 --> R3
     O1 --> R1
     O2 --> R2
     O3 --> R3
   ```
   ```

2. **Execution Plan Visualization**
   * Use Mermaid's flowchart syntax to represent Oracle execution plans
   * Show operations and their sequence
   * Include cost estimates where relevant
   * Example:
   ```
   ```mermaid
   flowchart TD
     A["SELECT Statement"] --> B["HASH JOIN"]
     B --> C["TABLE ACCESS FULL<br/>Customers"]
     B --> D["TABLE ACCESS BY INDEX ROWID<br/>Orders"]
     D --> E["INDEX RANGE SCAN<br/>Orders_Customer_IX"]
   ```
   ```

3. **Decision Trees**
   * Use Mermaid's flowchart syntax with decision nodes
   * Include clear conditions and outcomes
   * Use consistent notation
   * Example:
   ```
   ```mermaid
   flowchart TD
     A{"Need all matched<br/>rows only?"} -->|Yes| B["Use INNER JOIN"]
     A -->|No| C{"Need unmatched<br/>rows from first table?"}
     C -->|Yes| D["Use LEFT JOIN"]
     C -->|No| E{"Need unmatched<br/>rows from second table?"}
     E -->|Yes| F["Use RIGHT JOIN"]
     E -->|No| G{"Need unmatched rows<br/>from both tables?"}
     G -->|Yes| H["Use FULL OUTER JOIN"]
     G -->|No| I["Revisit requirements"]
   ```
   ```

4. **Performance Comparison Diagrams**
   * Use Mermaid's flowchart or graph syntax for comparative visualizations
   * Include metrics for comparison
   * Use clear visual indicators for better/worse approaches
   * Example:
   ```
   ```mermaid
   graph LR
     subgraph "Indexed JOIN"
       A1["Query Cost: 24"]
       B1["Execution Time: 0.5s"]
       C1["Buffer Gets: 85"]
     end
     
     subgraph "Non-Indexed JOIN"
       A2["Query Cost: 1240"]
       B2["Execution Time: 8.2s"]
       C2["Buffer Gets: 12500"]
     end
     
     A1 --- A2
     B1 --- B2
     C1 --- C2
   ```
   ```

Ensure all diagrams:
* Have clear titles
* Use consistent notation throughout
* Include legends where appropriate
* Are properly formatted with the ```mermaid syntax
* Enhance rather than duplicate the text content
