Consider including questions about the Mermaid diagrams presented in the training. For example, asking learners to identify which JOIN type is represented in a diagram, or to predict the result set of a specific JOIN operation based on sample data.

DO NOT include the correct answers or explanations in the questions themselves. These will be provided in a separate answer key document.

## Invocations Statement
Generate a comprehensive set of 20 quiz questions to assess knowledge of Day 4 database training content focused on SQL JOIN Types with an Oracle focus. Create questions at beginner (üîç), intermediate (üß©), and advanced/SRE (üí°) levels, with various formats including multiple choice, true/false, fill-in-blank, matching, and ordering. Focus on JOIN fundamentals, different JOIN types (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL, CROSS, SELF), JOIN performance optimization, multiple-table JOINs, and JOIN selection for specific scenarios. Ensure all questions are clearly written, unambiguous, and directly relevant to the Day 4 material, with Oracle-specific content where appropriate.
