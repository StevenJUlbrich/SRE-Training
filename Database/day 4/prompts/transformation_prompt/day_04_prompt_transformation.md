### 🔍 Prompt 4: *Follow-the-Sun Chronicles* – Day 4: Luis & The Case of the Missing Rows

> You are continuing the serialized, character-driven training series **The Follow-the-Sun Chronicles**, where each day is led by a fictional SRE based in a different part of the world.
>
> For **Day 4**, your character is:
> - **Name:** Luis  
> - **Location:** Spain (Madrid)  
> - **Time:** 09:00 CET  
> - **Role:** Incident responder and forensic JOIN analyst  
> - **Personality:** Patient, detailed, has a detective’s mindset; thinks LEFT JOINs are crime scenes  
>
> You are rewriting the **Day 4 SRE Database Training Module**, which covers:
> - Relational data retrieval using SQL JOINs  
> - JOIN types: INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL OUTER, CROSS, SELF  
> - ANSI vs Oracle legacy JOIN syntax  
> - Join performance, indexing, and real-world query tuning  
>
> **Constraints & style:**
> 1. Maintain the original training structure and **technical completeness**, including:  
>    - Beginner → Intermediate → SRE-level Learning Objectives  
>    - Diagrams, SQL syntax, use-case examples, system impact, and misconceptions  
>    - Cross-database JOIN syntax notes (Oracle vs PostgreSQL vs SQL Server)  
> 2. Narrate from **Luis’s POV** throughout the document:  
>    - He approaches JOINs like an investigator: looking for matches, tracking down orphans, analyzing cause and effect  
>    - He is calm but visibly frustrated by unnecessary FULL OUTER JOINs  
>    - Occasionally references past “incidents” to illustrate points  
> 3. Begin with a **mini incident vignette**: a report of missing data on an “Order Details” screen leads Luis to discover a broken INNER JOIN  
> 4. Use **Mermaid diagrams** to visualize:  
>    - JOIN logic (e.g., INNER vs LEFT vs FULL)  
>    - Multi-table JOIN paths  
>    - Data flow from tables into result sets  
>    - Include `autonumber` for all `sequenceDiagram` blocks  
>    - Use `&commat;` instead of `@` in any emails  
> 5. Each JOIN type should include:  
>    - A real-world analogy (e.g., INNER JOIN = “guest list at a party”)  
>    - Visual representation (Mermaid)  
>    - SQL syntax examples (Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQL Server if applicable)  
>    - Common mistakes or performance traps  
>    - Use-case relevance for SREs or support engineers  
> 6. Include a **troubleshooting flowchart** in Mermaid showing how Luis identifies a missing row caused by an incorrect JOIN  
> 7. Conclude with an **SRE performance optimization note**: how JOINs affect execution plans, indexing, and database health under load  
> 8. End with a **handoff to Jin in South Korea**, who will cover SQL aggregation in Day 5.
>
> **Tone:**
> - Calm, methodical, noir-detective energy  
> - Technical and precise, with dry humor  
> - Luis is not here to play games with Cartesian products
>
> This is a **professional training document**, but told as a narrated SRE detective story—with structure, facts, and a burning hatred for ambiguous foreign keys.
