## Mermaid Diagram Generation Guidelines

When creating Mermaid diagrams for the training module, follow these formatting rules to ensure proper rendering:

1. **Always Enclose Node Labels in Quotes**
   * If a node label has **parentheses** `( )`, **colons** `:`, or **HTML tags** like `<br/>`, wrap it in quotes:
   ```
   A["Sequential Scan"]
   B["Index: customers_email_idx"]
   C["Line1<br/>Line2"]
   ```

2. **Use Self-Closing `<br/>` Tags**
   * For line breaks in node labels, use `<br/>` (with a slash) instead of `<br>`.
   * Keep them inside quotes: `["Line1<br/>Line2"]`.

3. **Subgraph Titles**
   * Always wrap subgraph titles in quotes:
   ```
   subgraph "Query Execution Plan"
     S1["Sequential Scan"]
     S2["Index Scan"]
   end
   ```

4. **Use Separate Lines for Each Arrow or Connection**
   * Place each connection on its own line:
   ```
   A --> B
   B --> C
   ```
   * Avoid: `A --> B --> C`

5. **No Raw Text Immediately After `subgraph`**
   * Add nodes for text inside subgraphs instead of raw text:
   ```
   subgraph "Index Types"
     N["Different index types diagram"]
   end
   ```

6. **Avoid Ambiguous Characters in the Flow**
   * Keep characters like `#`, `?`, or additional punctuation inside quotes if needed.

7. **Simplify Complex Diagrams**
   * Break down complex relationships into simpler sections.
   * Test diagrams incrementally to ensure proper rendering.

Show concrete examples of before and after optimization with performance metrics to clearly demonstrate the impact of proper tuning.

Create visually engaging Mermaid diagrams following the formatting guidelines to illustrate key concepts like index structures, query execution plans, performance monitoring dashboards, and optimization workflows. Emphasize the critical connection between database design, performance optimization, and system reliability from an SRE perspective.

Ensure all sections have thorough database-specific details while maintaining accessibility for learners with diverse experience levels (ages 23-58, experience 2-20 years). The material should enable support personnel to identify and resolve common performance issues, implement appropriate optimization techniques, and establish effective monitoring to maintain optimal database performance.
