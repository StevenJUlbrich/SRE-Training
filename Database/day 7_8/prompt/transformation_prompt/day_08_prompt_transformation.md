Excellent choice. You’ve now reached **Day 8**, and it’s Elijah’s time to shine—or more accurately, to **monitor**, **triage**, and **optimize** your database like it’s a live concert feed with a million screaming users.

Elijah is your **advanced query tuning and observability pro**, the person who has *opinions* about execution plan stability, thinks `V$ACTIVE_SESSION_HISTORY` is bedtime reading, and mutters about cardinality estimates in his sleep.

Here’s the full prompt for **Day 8 of The Follow-the-Sun Chronicles**:

### 🖥️ Prompt: *Follow-the-Sun Chronicles* – Day 8: Elijah & the Latency That Lurks

> You're continuing the **Follow-the-Sun Chronicles**, a serialized global SRE training series where each day is led by a fictional character from a different region.
>
> For **Day 8**, your character is:
> - **Name:** Elijah  
> - **Location:** South Africa (Cape Town)  
> - **Time:** 08:00 SAST  
> - **Role:** Senior SRE and database telemetry specialist  
> - **Personality:** Tactical, ultra-composed, dry humor. Thinks in query stats. Can debug a slow write path just by squinting at I/O graphs.  
>
> You're rewriting the **Day 8 SRE Database Training Module**, focused on:
> - Advanced query tuning strategies  
> - Performance monitoring and telemetry integration  
> - Query plan stability and regression detection  
> - Oracle tuning tools (AWR, ASH, SQL Tuning Advisor)  
> - Runtime stats: session waits, CPU, IOPS, blocking sessions  
> - Observability tooling (SQL tracing, dashboards, alerting)
>
> **Constraints & Style:**
> 1. Preserve the original technical structure and content from Day 8:  
>    - Tiered learning objectives  
>    - Core concepts with diagrams, SQL syntax, performance tools  
>    - Monitoring strategy and response workflows  
> 2. Narrate from **Elijah’s point of view** throughout:  
>    - He treats monitoring like a first-class citizen—equal to queries and schemas  
>    - Approaches slowdowns like incidents to be investigated, not just fixed  
>    - Speaks with seasoned clarity—less flashy, more factual, very capable  
> 3. Begin with a real incident: Elijah gets paged due to a gradual latency spike. Root cause: an unstable query plan that switched from hash join to nested loop due to stats drift.  
> 4. Use **Mermaid diagrams** extensively:  
>    - Show query execution flows (parse → optimize → execute → fetch)  
>    - Dashboards + alert flow for monitored query issues  
>    - Execution plan comparison (old vs new)  
>    - `sequenceDiagram` blocks must use `autonumber`  
>    - Use `&commat;` in place of `@` in any emails  
> 5. Every tuning tool (AWR, ASH, DBMS_XPLAN, SQL Monitoring) must include:  
>    - What it is  
>    - What problem it solves  
>    - Example SQL usage  
>    - Typical output or metric examples  
>    - How Elijah uses it to debug live systems  
> 6. Include a **sequenceDiagram** showing alert → investigation → root cause → fix → postmortem  
> 7. Include a **flowchart** for performance triage: e.g., is it CPU-bound, I/O-bound, lock-bound, or plan-stupid?  
> 8. Add commentary on metrics Elijah always watches, such as:  
>    - Query latency (P95, P99)  
>    - Buffer cache hit ratio  
>    - Log file sync wait events  
>    - Execution count vs CPU time ratio  
> 9. End with a **monitoring “go bag” list** Elijah always keeps ready (tools, queries, dashboards, alert thresholds)  
> 10. Handoff to Chloé in France, who will cover Day 9 on SQL vs NoSQL architecture decisions and operational tradeoffs.
>
> **Tone:**  
> - Professional, focused, calm under fire  
> - Hints of dry sarcasm when discussing “accidental Cartesian joins” or people ignoring SQL tracing  
> - Reads like a real SRE playbook—but personal, grounded, and narrative-driven
