## Answer 1: Basic Terminology
üü¢ Beginner | Multiple Choice

**Question:**  
Which of the following statements best describes a table in a relational database?

A. A table is an entire database containing multiple schemas and objects.  
B. A table is a collection of rows and columns storing related data.  
C. A table is a single row of data used for auditing purposes.  
D. A table is an Oracle-specific feature that replaces schemas.

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**  
A table in a relational database is the fundamental data structure that holds rows (records) and columns (attributes). In Oracle, tables are owned by a schema (user) and can be queried or manipulated using SQL. They do not replace schemas nor do they represent the entire database.

**Why other options are incorrect:**
- **Option A:** Describes a database, not a table.  
- **Option C:** A single row is just one record, not an entire table.  
- **Option D:** Tables are a standard feature in all relational databases, not just an Oracle replacement for schemas.

**Oracle Comparison Note:**  
In PostgreSQL and SQL Server, the concept of a table is nearly identical, though some data types and storage mechanisms differ.

**Knowledge Connection:**  
This question connects to the *Relational Database Structure* section of the Day 1 material, emphasizing how tables form the basis of data organization.

**SRE Perspective:**  
Understanding the basic structure of a table is essential for monitoring row growth, disk usage, and performance in production systems.

**Additional Insight:**  
Use `DESCRIBE table_name;` in SQL*Plus or the GUI in SQL Developer to inspect the columns of an Oracle table quickly.

## Answer 2: Key Fundamentals
üü¢ Beginner | Multiple Choice

**Question:**  
Which characteristic is TRUE of a primary key in Oracle?

A. It allows duplicate values but must be indexed.  
B. It uniquely identifies each row and cannot be NULL.  
C. It can reference itself in the same table.  
D. It can only be numeric.

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**  
A primary key enforces uniqueness in a column (or set of columns) so that every row can be identified distinctly. Oracle requires that primary key columns cannot contain NULL values, ensuring reliable identification of each row.

**Why other options are incorrect:**
- **Option A:** Primary keys do not allow duplicates.  
- **Option C:** Self-referencing primary keys are uncommon; more often you see foreign keys referencing a primary key, not the primary key referencing itself.  
- **Option D:** Primary key columns can be of various data types (e.g., VARCHAR2, NUMBER), not strictly numeric.

**Oracle Comparison Note:**  
PostgreSQL and SQL Server also require primary keys to be unique and non-null. PostgreSQL often uses `SERIAL` for auto-incrementing numeric primary keys, whereas Oracle generally uses sequences.

**Knowledge Connection:**  
Links to *Primary Keys and Foreign Keys in Oracle*, highlighting how keys maintain data integrity.

**SRE Perspective:**  
A well-defined primary key ensures quick lookups and stable references, crucial for system reliability and efficient troubleshooting.

**Additional Insight:**  
Define primary keys at table creation or using an `ALTER TABLE` statement to enforce data integrity from the start.

## Answer 3: Basic SELECT Statement
üü¢ Beginner | Multiple Choice

**Question:**  
Which of the following SQL statements retrieves all columns from a table named EMPLOYEES in Oracle?

A. SELECT ALL FROM EMPLOYEES;  
B. SELECT EMPLOYEES.*;  
C. SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES;  
D. SELECT EMP_ID, EMP_NAME FROM EMPLOYEES;

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**  
The standard SQL syntax for retrieving all columns from a table is `SELECT * FROM table_name;`. Options A and B are not valid Oracle statements for retrieving all columns, and option D retrieves only two specific columns.

**Why other options are incorrect:**
- **Option A:** `SELECT ALL FROM EMPLOYEES;` is invalid syntax in Oracle.  
- **Option B:** Oracle does not accept `SELECT EMPLOYEES.*` outside of a joined context with an alias (and even then, it‚Äôs typically `SELECT e.* FROM employees e;`).  
- **Option D:** Only retrieves two columns, not all columns.

**Oracle Comparison Note:**  
In PostgreSQL and SQL Server, the syntax `SELECT * FROM table_name;` is also valid. The asterisk indicates all columns.

**Knowledge Connection:**  
Relates to the *Basic SQL SELECT Statement* concept, showing the simplest form of a query.

**SRE Perspective:**  
Using `SELECT *` can lead to unnecessary data retrieval and potential performance overhead in large tables. Monitoring query performance is key in production.

**Additional Insight:**  
When performance or clarity matters, avoid `SELECT *` and explicitly list needed columns.

## Answer 4: Basic ER Diagram
üü¢ Beginner | Multiple Choice | Diagram-Based

**Question:**  
Examine the following simple entity-relationship diagram:



![Mermaid Diagram: classdiagram](images/diagram-1-eb6c65a8.png)



Which statement best describes this relationship?

A. Each Department can have many Employees, and each Employee belongs to one Department.  
B. Each Employee can have many Departments, and each Department belongs to one Employee.  
C. Department and Employee are unrelated tables.  
D. The diagram shows a many-to-many relationship.

**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanation:**  
The notation "1" -- "n" indicates a one-to-many relationship: one Department can manage many Employees, but each Employee belongs to a single Department. This is a common real-world model in HR systems.

**Why other options are incorrect:**
- **Option B:** Reverses the relationship, suggesting each Employee can have many Departments. That‚Äôs unusual unless it‚Äôs a many-to-many scenario with bridging tables.  
- **Option C:** The diagram clearly shows a relationship.  
- **Option D:** A many-to-many relationship would typically show "m" -- "n" with a linking entity.

**Oracle Comparison Note:**  
Creating this relationship in Oracle typically involves a foreign key from `EMPLOYEE` to `DEPARTMENT`. Other RDBMS behave similarly.

**Knowledge Connection:**  
Connects to *Relational Database Structure* and *Primary/Foreign Keys*, showing how tables relate via a foreign key (`dept_id` in `Employee` referencing `dept_id` in `Department`).

**SRE Perspective:**  
Proper relationships prevent data anomalies and simplify system maintenance. SREs benefit from well-modeled schemas to troubleshoot relational inconsistencies.

**Additional Insight:**  
In Oracle, you can query `ALL_CONSTRAINTS` to confirm the foreign key constraint between these two tables.

**Enhanced Visual Explanation:**  
The "1" indicates a single department record, while "n" indicates multiple employee records referencing that department.

## Answer 6: Basic SQL Clauses
üü¢ Beginner | Multiple Choice

**Question:**  
In a basic SELECT statement, the FROM clause is used to:

A. Specify the conditions for filtering rows.  
B. Identify the table(s) from which to retrieve data.  
C. Group rows based on common values.  
D. Indicate a new database connection.

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**  
The `FROM` clause in a SELECT statement defines which table(s) or view(s) the query will access. Without it, the database does not know the data source.

**Why other options are incorrect:**
- **Option A:** Describes the role of the `WHERE` clause.  
- **Option C:** Describes `GROUP BY`.  
- **Option D:** Database connections are handled by connection strings, not the FROM clause.

**Oracle Comparison Note:**  
SQL syntax is similar across Oracle, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server for specifying the table source via `FROM`.

**Knowledge Connection:**  
Builds on the *Basic SQL SELECT Statement* focus, reinforcing fundamental query structure.

**SRE Perspective:**  
Multi-table queries in large environments can be performance-intensive, so SREs monitor how the FROM clause is used with joins and indexes.

**Additional Insight:**  
Always confirm your `FROM` sources when troubleshooting ‚Äútable not found‚Äù or ‚Äúambiguous column‚Äù errors.

## Answer 7: Query Execution Flow
üü¢ Beginner | Multiple Choice | Diagram-Based

**Question:**  
Refer to this simplified query execution flow:



![Mermaid Diagram: flowchart](images/diagram-2-0559ee19.png)



Which step ensures the SQL statement is valid and constructs the best plan?

A. Parsing  
B. Optimization  
C. Execution  
D. Result Return

**Correct Answer:** B (Optimization)

**Explanation:**  
During optimization, Oracle‚Äôs query optimizer evaluates different execution strategies (e.g., whether to perform a full table scan or use an index range scan) to find the most efficient plan. Parsing checks syntax and semantics, while execution runs the plan.

**Why other options are incorrect:**
- **Option A (Parsing):** Validates syntax but does not construct the best plan; it just checks for correctness.  
- **Option C (Execution):** Executes the plan, not optimizes it.  
- **Option D (Result Return):** Simply sends the result set back to the client.

**Oracle Comparison Note:**  
All major RDBMS have an optimization phase, but each may use different cost models or heuristics.

**Knowledge Connection:**  
Relates directly to *Oracle Performance Monitoring and Execution Plans*, underscoring the importance of query optimization.

**SRE Perspective:**  
SREs must understand optimization to troubleshoot long-running queries. Monitoring query plans helps identify performance bottlenecks.

**Additional Insight:**

üü° Intermediate | Multiple Choice

**Question:**  
Which SQL statement creates a foreign key in an Oracle table named ORDERS that references the CUSTOMERS table‚Äôs primary key CUSTOMER_ID?

A. ALTER TABLE orders ADD CONSTRAINT fk_cust_id REFERENCES customers(customer_id);  
B. CREATE FOREIGN KEY fk_cust_id ON orders(customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id);  
C. ALTER TABLE orders ADD CONSTRAINT fk_cust_id FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id);  
D. CREATE TABLE orders FOREIGN KEY fk_cust_id (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id);

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**  
In Oracle, you typically use the `ALTER TABLE ... ADD CONSTRAINT <constraint_name> FOREIGN KEY (<column>) REFERENCES <table>(<column>)` syntax to create a foreign key constraint after the table is already created. Option C precisely matches Oracle‚Äôs foreign key definition.

**Why other options are incorrect:**
- **Option A:** Missing the `FOREIGN KEY` clause.  
- **Option B:** The keyword `CREATE FOREIGN KEY` is invalid.  
- **Option D:** This syntax is incorrect when adding a foreign key to an existing table.

**Oracle Comparison Note:**  
PostgreSQL and SQL Server use similar `ALTER TABLE` statements for foreign key creation, though some data type matching requirements may differ.

**Knowledge Connection:**  
Links to *Primary Keys and Foreign Keys in Oracle*, emphasizing constraint definitions.

**SRE Perspective:**  
Foreign key constraints ensure referential integrity. In production, improper foreign key definitions can lead to orphan data or referential errors.

Which of the following statements is correct?

A. A single datafile belongs to multiple tablespaces.  
B. Each tablespace can have one or more datafiles.  
C. Users/Schemas cannot own tables.  
D. Oracle databases do not use tablespaces.

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**  
In Oracle, a tablespace can consist of one or multiple datafiles. A single datafile cannot span multiple tablespaces, and users/schemas do own tables.

**Why other options are incorrect:**
- **Option A:** Datafiles belong to exactly one tablespace.  
- **Option C:** Schemas (users) do own tables in Oracle.  
- **Option D:** Tablespaces are a core Oracle concept for logical data storage management.

**Oracle Comparison Note:**  
PostgreSQL doesn‚Äôt use the same ‚Äútablespace‚Äù concept by default (though it does support tablespaces at a filesystem level). SQL Server has filegroups.

**Knowledge Connection:**  
Ties to *Oracle Hierarchy Visualization* (schemas, tablespaces, datafiles).

**SRE Perspective:**  
Monitoring tablespace usage and datafile growth is vital to ensure the database does not run out of space, impacting reliability.

**Additional Insight:**  
Use `DBA_DATA_FILES` and `DBA_TABLESPACES` views to check size, status, and auto-extend settings in Oracle.

## Answer 10: Table Joins
üü° Intermediate | Multiple Choice | Diagram-Based

**Question:**  
Analyze the following join diagram:



![Mermaid Diagram: flowchart](images/diagram-4-3166ff27.png)



Which SQL statement best represents this join in Oracle?

A. SELECT * FROM customers, orders;  
B. SELECT * FROM customers JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;  
C. SELECT * FROM customers JOIN orders ON name = order_date;  
D. SELECT * FROM customers FULL JOIN orders;

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**  
The diagram shows a direct link between `customer_id` in `CUSTOMERS` and `ORDERS`. The correct Oracle syntax for an inner join that matches on these columns is `JOIN ... ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id`.

**Why other options are incorrect:**
- **Option A:** Lists both tables but does not specify a JOIN condition. In Oracle, this would be a Cartesian join without a WHERE clause.  
- **Option C:** Uses non-matching columns (`name` and `order_date`).  
- **Option D:** `FULL JOIN` includes unmatched rows from both tables, which is not implied by the diagram.

**Oracle Comparison Note:**  
PostgreSQL and SQL Server syntax for an inner join is the same (`JOIN ... ON ...`). Some older Oracle versions allow the `FROM customers, orders WHERE customers.customer_id = ...`, but the modern ANSI JOIN is preferred.

**Knowledge Connection:**  
Demonstrates the *FROM Clause and Table Selection* plus *Basic SQL SELECT Statement*, specifically multi-table joins.

**SRE Perspective:**  
Incorrect join conditions can produce massive result sets or lead to missing data. SREs monitor query plans to confirm that proper indexes and join strategies are used.

**Additional Insight:**  
Inner joins only return rows where the join condition matches, while outer joins return unmatched rows from one or both tables.

## Answer 11: Data Dictionary Views
üü° Intermediate | True/False

**Question:**  
Statement: The ALL_TABLES view in Oracle shows all the tables in the entire database, regardless of the current user‚Äôs privileges.

A. True  
B. False

**Correct Answer:** B (False)

**Explanation:**  
`ALL_TABLES` in Oracle lists all tables **accessible** to the current user (including those owned by other users but granted privileges). To see *all* tables in the database, you would query `DBA_TABLES`. Thus, it does not ignore privileges.

**Oracle Comparison Note:**  
PostgreSQL‚Äôs `pg_catalog` schema contains various views showing table metadata, but visibility also depends on privileges. SQL Server has similar metadata views (e.g., `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES`), also subject to permissions.

**Knowledge Connection:**  
Relates to *Oracle-Specific Tools and Techniques*, where understanding the data dictionary is crucial for daily admin tasks.

**SRE Perspective:**  
Visibility into database objects is essential for diagnosing issues. Knowing how to check table existence and privileges can speed up troubleshooting.

**Question:**  
Statement: The V$SESSION view in Oracle provides details about current active sessions, including user, status, and machine information.

A. True  
B. False

**Correct Answer:** A (True)

**Explanation:**  
`V$SESSION` is a critical performance view containing session-level information (user, machine, status, etc.). Administrators and SREs commonly use it to identify which sessions are active and potentially causing contention.

**Oracle Comparison Note:**  
Neither PostgreSQL nor SQL Server uses the same naming convention. PostgreSQL‚Äôs `pg_stat_activity` and SQL Server‚Äôs `sys.dm_exec_sessions` offer comparable session data.

**Knowledge Connection:**  
Links to the *Oracle Performance Monitoring and Execution Plans* section, highlighting how to inspect session activity.

**SRE Perspective:**  
Actively monitoring sessions helps detect blocking sessions or runaway queries, which is crucial for maintaining reliability.

**Additional Insight:**  
`V$SESSION` columns like `STATUS`, `USERNAME`, `OSUSER`, and `MACHINE` aid in tracing performance issues to specific applications or users.

## Answer 13: SQL Dialect Variations
üü° Intermediate | True/False

**Question:**  
Statement: In Oracle, the VARCHAR2 data type is functionally identical to VARCHAR2 in PostgreSQL and SQL Server with no differences in behavior or limits.

A. True  
B. False

**Correct Answer:** B (False)

**Explanation:**  
While `VARCHAR2` in Oracle is similar to `VARCHAR` in other systems, there are differences in maximum lengths, character sets, and semantic nuances (e.g., how trailing spaces are handled). Oracle‚Äôs `VARCHAR2` also historically differs from `VARCHAR` in some edge-case behaviors.

**Oracle Comparison Note:**  
PostgreSQL typically uses `VARCHAR(n)` or `TEXT`; SQL Server uses `VARCHAR(n)` or `NVARCHAR(n)`. Limits and behaviors vary.

**Knowledge Connection:**  
Ties into *SQL Dialect Comparison* from Day 1, showing Oracle‚Äôs unique data type specifics.

**SRE Perspective:**  
When migrating or integrating systems, differences in data types can cause data truncation or errors if not carefully handled.

## Answer 14: SQL WHERE
üü° Intermediate | Fill-in-the-Blank

**Question:**  
Complete the following statement about the Oracle WHERE clause:

"A WHERE clause is used to ________ the rows returned by a SELECT statement based on specified conditions."

A. rearrange  
B. aggregate  
C. combine  
D. filter  

**Correct Answer:** D ‚Äì filter

**Explanation:**  
The WHERE clause refines (filters) the result set by selecting only rows that match specified criteria (e.g., `WHERE employee_id = 101`). It does not rearrange, aggregate, or combine rows.

**Why other options are incorrect:**
- **Option A (rearrange):** That describes `ORDER BY`.  
- **Option B (aggregate):** That pertains to functions like SUM, COUNT, not the WHERE clause.  
- **Option C (combine):** Combining datasets is typically done via JOIN or UNION.

**Oracle Comparison Note:**  
In all major RDBMS, the WHERE clause is used for row filtering. Syntax is essentially the same.

**Knowledge Connection:**  
Directly addresses the *WHERE Clause and Basic Filtering* concept.

**SRE Perspective:**  
Effective filtering reduces the load on databases, minimizing unnecessary data retrieval. SREs monitor queries to ensure they use proper WHERE clauses and indexes.

**Additional Insight:**  
Use appropriate indexes on columns often referenced in the WHERE clause for better performance in Oracle.

B. TABLE ACCESS (FULL)  
C. NESTED LOOPS  
D. HASH JOIN  

**Correct Answer:** B ‚Äì TABLE ACCESS (FULL)

**Explanation:**  
`TABLE ACCESS (FULL)` means Oracle is scanning every row of the table, which can be costly for large tables lacking suitable indexes or up-to-date statistics. This is often a red flag for potential performance issues.

**Why other options are incorrect:**
- **Option A:** `INDEX RANGE SCAN` indicates use of an index, usually more efficient.  
- **Option C:** `NESTED LOOPS` is a join method, not a scan type.  
- **Option D:** `HASH JOIN` is another join method, not a scan type.

**Oracle Comparison Note:**  
PostgreSQL might show a similar concept as `Seq Scan` in an `EXPLAIN` plan. SQL Server uses `Table Scan` or `Index Scan/Seek`.

**Knowledge Connection:**  
Relates to *Oracle Performance Monitoring and Execution Plans*, highlighting how to interpret plan output.

**SRE Perspective:**  
SREs watch for full table scans on critical queries to avoid performance degradation.
