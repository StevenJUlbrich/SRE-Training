## üéØ Objective
Create a comprehensive, visually engaging module on cross-database concepts that:
- Assumes prior knowledge of basic relational database concepts and SQL fundamentals
- Builds an understanding of how core data concepts manifest across different database paradigms
- Provides clear translation patterns between relational, document, and streaming models
- Compares and contrasts syntax, structure, and operational considerations across systems
- Highlights key differences in reliability, scalability, and monitoring approaches
- Presents real-world scenarios where different database types might be used together
- Emphasizes practical cross-database troubleshooting and operational knowledge
- Demonstrates how SRE principles apply across different database paradigms
- Ensures smooth transitions between concepts with explicit knowledge scaffolding
- Uses rich visual aids to illustrate paradigm translations and operational flows

## üë• Target Audience
