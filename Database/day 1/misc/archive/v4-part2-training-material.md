# üåê Cross-Database Concepts Training Module

## Bridging Relational, NoSQL, and Streaming for Modern SRE Environments

---

## üìå Introduction

Welcome to this specialized module on **cross-database concepts**‚Äîyour next step after mastering **relational database fundamentals**. Modern systems increasingly blend **relational** (e.g., **Oracle**, **PostgreSQL**, **SQL Server**), **NoSQL** (e.g., **MongoDB**), and **streaming** (e.g., **Kafka**) technologies to solve diverse data challenges. As an **SRE** or **Support** engineer, you‚Äôll often troubleshoot issues involving multiple database paradigms simultaneously.

### Why Cross-Database Knowledge Matters

- **Integrated Systems**: Applications commonly rely on multiple data stores for different use cases.  
- **Optimized Choices**: Certain data patterns (e.g., key-value, large documents, real-time streams) may be better served by non-relational or streaming platforms.  
- **SRE Reliability**: Understanding how each system behaves under load, how to monitor it, and how to recover from failures is crucial to keeping SLAs intact.

Below is a **visual paradigm map** illustrating the relationship among relational, document, and streaming approaches:

```plaintext
   Relational DBs    <--->     NoSQL (Document)     <--->    Streaming Systems
       (SQL)                       (MongoDB)                 (Kafka, Real-Time)
         ^                                 ^                         ^
         | Integration                     |                         |
         v                                 v                         v
                    Hybrid Architecture with Multiple Databases
```

**Real-World Examples**:

- A mission-critical ecommerce platform might store **customer profiles** in MongoDB for flexible schemas, **order transactions** in PostgreSQL for ACID compliance, and use **Kafka** for real-time analytics on user events.

## üåâ Knowledge Bridge

### Recap of Relational Foundations

You‚Äôve learned how tables, rows, columns, and SQL queries (SELECT, FROM, WHERE) form the backbone of **relational databases**. Let‚Äôs extend that knowledge:

- **MongoDB** (Document-oriented):
  - **Collections** instead of tables  
  - **Documents** (JSON-like) instead of rows  
  - **Fields** instead of columns  
- **Kafka** (Streaming platform):
  - **Topics** instead of tables  
  - **Messages** instead of rows  
  - Data typically ephemeral; offset-based consumption

### Visual Cross-Paradigm Translation Table

| Concept         | Relational                    | Document (MongoDB)                   | Streaming (Kafka)                      |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Data Unit**   | Row                           | Document (JSON/BSON)                 | Message (Key + Value)                  |
| **Data Group**  | Table                         | Collection                           | Topic                                  |
| **Schema**      | Predefined columns & types    | Dynamic schema (can vary by doc)     | No strict schema, though Avro/Protobuf often used |
| **Query**       | SQL (SELECT, JOIN, etc.)      | `db.collection.find()`, pipelines    | Consumers, KSQL, or streaming filters |
| **Indexing**    | B-tree, GIN, etc.             | Single/multi-field indexes           | Partitioning, offset-based ordering    |
| **Transactions**| ACID (traditional)            | Document-level atomicity (multi-doc in newer versions) | Exactly-once or at-least-once processing, offset commits |

### Relative Strengths

- **Relational**: Strong consistency, structured schema, robust ACID transactions.
- **Document**: Flexible schema, easy to store nested data, horizontal scaling.
- **Streaming**: Real-time event processing at scale, decoupled pub/sub model.

**Hybrid Approaches** are common: for instance, a microservice might log events to Kafka, store user settings in MongoDB, and rely on PostgreSQL for transactional data.

## üìö Core Cross-Database Concepts

### 1. Data Structure Translation

**Relational Model**  

- **Tables** with strict columns.  
- Data typed per column (e.g., `VARCHAR`, `INT`).  
- **Example**:  

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE customers (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50)
  );
  ```

**Document Model (MongoDB)**  

- **Collections** store **documents** (BSON/JSON).  
- Each document can have different fields.  
- **Example**:

  ```javascript
  db.customers.insertOne({
    customer_id: 1,
    first_name: "Alice",
    last_name: "Anderson"
  });
  ```

**Streaming Model (Kafka)**  

- **Topics** store **messages** in partitions.  
- Each message has a key (optional) and a value.  
- **Example** (CLI produce a JSON message):

  ```bash
  echo '{"customer_id":1,"first_name":"Alice"}' | \
    kafka-console-producer --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic customers
  ```

**üñºÔ∏è Visual Representation**:

```plaintext
Relational (customers table)   Document (customers collection)   Streaming (customers topic)
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê    {                               Stream of messages:
‚îÇcustomer_id ‚îÇfirst_name  ‚îÇ    "customer_id": 1,               { key: null, value:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îº‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î§    "first_name": "Alice",          {"customer_id":1,"first_name":"Alice"} }
‚îÇ     1      ‚îÇ  Alice     ‚îÇ    "last_name": "Anderson"         ...
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò    }                               
```

**üî¨ Technical Comparison**:

- **Relational**: schema-bound, well-defined constraints.  
- **Document**: flexible, can store complex nested structures.  
- **Streaming**: ephemeral or persistent logs of events, minimal structural constraints.

**üíº Support/SRE Application**:

- Understanding structure helps in **data retrieval** and **troubleshooting**.  
- Distinguish which system is the ‚Äúsource of truth‚Äù vs. derived data.

**üîÑ System Impact**:

- **Relational**: CPU-bound on large joins.  
- **Document**: Potentially big data sets if documents are large.  
- **Streaming**: High throughput, sequential storage on disk.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Common Misconceptions**:

- *‚ÄúDocument DBs have no structure.‚Äù* They do, just more flexible.  
- *‚ÄúKafka is a database.‚Äù* Kafka is not a traditional DB; it‚Äôs a **distributed log**.

**üìù Translation Pattern**:

- **Relational ‚Üí Document**: Flatten or nest table rows into a single JSON object.  
- **Relational ‚Üí Streaming**: Emit each row change as a **message**.  
- **Document ‚Üí Relational**: Extract fields into columns or related tables.  
- **Document ‚Üí Streaming**: Send each inserted document as a **message**.  
- **Streaming ‚Üí Relational**: Batch or real-time insert from the topic into tables.  
- **Streaming ‚Üí Document**: Consume messages into a MongoDB collection (ETL pipeline).

---

### 2. Query Operation Translation

**Relational**: `SELECT`, `JOIN`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`  
**Document**: `.find()`, `$lookup`, aggregation pipelines (`$match`, `$group`)  
**Streaming**: consumer reads, filter logic, `ksqlDB` or Kafka Streams for joins

**üñºÔ∏è Visual Representation**:

```plaintext
   Relational Query   ‚îÄ‚îÄ>   Document Query   ‚îÄ‚îÄ>   Stream Processing
      (SQL)                (Mongo find)          (Consumers/KSQL)
```

**üî¨ Technical Comparison**:

- **JOIN** in relational ‚Üí `$lookup` in MongoDB, or **table-stream join** in Kafka Streams.  
- **WHERE** in SQL ‚Üí Query filter in Mongo: `db.collection.find({ age: { $gt: 30 } })` ‚Üí `KSQL`: `SELECT * FROM stream WHERE age > 30;`

**üíº Support/SRE Application**:

- Translating support tickets from ‚ÄúSQL language‚Äù to how you‚Äôd query the data in Mongo or Kafka is common in multi-DB environments.

**üîÑ System Impact**:

- Complex joins in Mongo can be slower without data modeling.  
- Kafka ‚Äújoins‚Äù can be stateful; watch out for memory usage.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Common Misconception**:

- *‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs easy in SQL, it‚Äôs easy in Mongo or Kafka.‚Äù* Each has unique query constraints.

**üìù Translation Pattern**:

- Always consider the **equivalent** operators. E.g., `WHERE name = 'Bob'` ‚Üí `db.collection.find({name:'Bob'})` ‚Üí `KSQL: SELECT * FROM stream WHERE name='Bob';`

---

### 3. Consistency & Transaction Models

**Relational** (Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQL Server):  

- **ACID** transactions  
- Multiple **isolation levels** (READ COMMITTED, SERIALIZABLE, etc.)

**Document** (MongoDB):  

- Historically **eventual consistency** for some operations  
- Now supports **multi-document transactions** (ACID) in replica set contexts  
- Typically simpler single-document atomic writes

**Streaming** (Kafka):  

- **Exactly-once**, **at-least-once**, or **at-most-once** consumption semantics  
- Transactional writes possible but more limited in scope (e.g., across partitions or topics)

**üñºÔ∏è Visual Representation**:

```plaintext
ACID (Relational) <----> Limited / Document-level (MongoDB) <----> Offsets & Semantics (Kafka)
```

**üíº Support/SRE Application**:

- If your application needs strict consistency, relational or certain Mongo replicas might be best.  
- For real-time event flows, Kafka‚Äôs ‚Äúexactly-once‚Äù or ‚Äúat-least-once‚Äù significantly affects data duplication or loss.

**System Impact**:

- Tighter consistency ‚Üí slower writes but more guaranteed correctness.  
- Eventual consistency ‚Üí faster writes but potential data staleness.

**Common Misconception**:

- *‚ÄúAll NoSQL is eventually consistent.‚Äù* MongoDB can have strong consistency in single replicas or multi-document transactions in modern versions.

**üìù Translation Pattern**:

- Evaluate your **consistency** needs. Translate a ‚ÄúSERIALIZABLE‚Äù requirement in relational to a carefully configured replica set or design in Mongo.  
- In Kafka, achieving ‚Äúexactly-once‚Äù requires idempotent producers and transactionally aware consumers.

---

### 4. Scaling Approaches

**Relational**:  

- Often **vertical scaling** (bigger machines) plus read replicas.  
- **Sharding** is possible but more complex.  
- Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL have specialized partitioning features.

**Document** (MongoDB):  

- Designed for **horizontal scaling** via built-in sharding.  
- Automatic balancing across shards.  
- Embedding data reduces the need for multi-collection joins.

**Streaming** (Kafka):  

- **Partition** topics for parallelism.  
- **Consumer groups** scale out consumption.  
- Adding brokers horizontally.

**üñºÔ∏è Visual Representation**:

```plaintext
[Relational Node]  + Scale up CPU/RAM  +  [Mongo Cluster] Shards horizontally  +  [Kafka Cluster] Partitions
```

**üíº Support/SRE Application**:

- Consider how expansions or spikes in load are handled.  
- For highly concurrent writes, document DB or streaming might scale more easily than a single relational instance.

**System Impact**:

- Sharding can complicate queries (e.g., scatter-gather).  
- Kafka partition imbalance can cause hotspots.  
- Oracle RAC or partitioned PostgreSQL requires specialized admin knowledge.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Common Misconception**:

- *‚ÄúMongoDB automatically solves all scaling.‚Äù* Sharding adds complexity; data distribution must be planned.

**üìù Translation Pattern**:

- **Vertical scale** in relational vs. **horizontal shards** in Mongo vs. **partition** in Kafka.  
- Ensure the data distribution strategy fits your queries to avoid hotspots.

---

## üíª Cross-Database Command & Query Translations

Below, we map **six common operations** across PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Kafka (representative of relational, document, and streaming). Note that Oracle/SQL Server have very similar **SQL** syntax to PostgreSQL with minimal differences.

---

### **Operation: Data Retrieval (basic fetch)**

**Relational Approach (PostgreSQL):**

```sql
-- Retrieve all rows from a table
SELECT customer_id, first_name, last_name
FROM customers
WHERE active = true;
```

**Document Approach (MongoDB):**

```javascript
// Find documents with active=true
db.customers.find(
  { active: true },
  { customer_id: 1, first_name: 1, last_name: 1, _id: 0 }
);
```

**Streaming Approach (Kafka):**

```bash
# Consume from a topic named 'customers' from the beginning
kafka-console-consumer --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
  --topic customers --from-beginning
# Filter logic may be done via Kafka Streams or KSQL, not here.
```

**Translation Notes**:

- PostgreSQL ‚ÄúWHERE active = true‚Äù ‚Üí Mongo ‚Äú{ active: true }‚Äù.  
- Kafka does not have a ‚Äútable‚Äù to fetch all rows; it‚Äôs a log stream.

**Cross-Database Operational Concerns**:

- Large SELECT in relational can cause heavy I/O.  
- Large find() in Mongo can also be expensive if unindexed.  
- Streaming reads are continuous‚Äîbe mindful of consumer offsets and memory usage.

---

### **Operation: Filtering (WHERE vs. query operators vs. stream filtering)**

**Relational Approach (PostgreSQL):**

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM orders
WHERE amount > 500 AND status = 'NEW';
```

**Document Approach (MongoDB):**

```javascript
db.orders.find(
  { amount: { $gt: 500 }, status: "NEW" }
);
```

**Streaming Approach (Kafka ‚Üí KSQL Example):**

```sql
CREATE STREAM orders_stream
  (order_id INT, amount DOUBLE, status VARCHAR)
  WITH (KAFKA_TOPIC='orders', VALUE_FORMAT='JSON');

SELECT order_id, amount, status
FROM orders_stream
WHERE amount > 500
  AND status = 'NEW'
EMIT CHANGES;
```

**Translation Notes**:

- In Mongo, `$gt` maps to ‚Äúgreater than‚Äù in SQL.  
- KSQL queries keep reading new messages as they arrive.

**Cross-Database Operational Concerns**:

- Indexing is crucial for both SQL and Mongo.  
- Kafka filters can be stateful if you do aggregations or windowing.

---

### **Operation: Aggregation (GROUP BY vs. Aggregation Pipeline vs. Stream Processing)**

**Relational Approach (PostgreSQL):**

```sql
SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) AS total_spent
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

**Document Approach (MongoDB) Aggregation Pipeline:**

```javascript
db.orders.aggregate([
  { $group: { 
      _id: "$customer_id", 
      total_spent: { $sum: "$amount" }
    } 
  }
]);
```

**Streaming Approach (Kafka Streams / KSQL):**

```sql
CREATE TABLE customer_spend AS
SELECT customer_id,
       SUM(amount) AS total_spent
FROM orders_stream
GROUP BY customer_id
EMIT CHANGES;
```

**Translation Notes**:

- Both SQL and Mongo group on a field. Mongo uses `$group` stage.  
- Kafka Streams can materialize a table with an ongoing sum.

**Cross-Database Operational Concerns**:

- Large aggregations in relational might need indexes or partitioning.  
- Mongo‚Äôs pipeline can get memory-heavy.  
- Kafka ‚Äútable‚Äù results rely on backing stores (RocksDB, etc.).

---

### **Operation: Relationships (JOIN vs. $lookup vs. stream joining)**

**Relational Approach (PostgreSQL):**

```sql
SELECT c.customer_id, c.first_name, o.order_id, o.amount
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.amount > 500;
```

**Document Approach (MongoDB):**

```javascript
db.customers.aggregate([
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "orders",
      localField: "customer_id",
      foreignField: "customer_id",
      as: "order_data"
    }
  },
  { $unwind: "$order_data" },
  { $match: { "order_data.amount": { $gt: 500 } } }
]);
```

**Streaming Approach (Kafka Streams / KSQL):**

```sql
CREATE STREAM customers_stream ...; 
CREATE STREAM orders_stream ...;

CREATE STREAM joined_stream AS
SELECT c.customer_id, c.first_name, o.order_id, o.amount
FROM customers_stream c
JOIN orders_stream o
  ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.amount > 500
EMIT CHANGES;
```

**Translation Notes**:

- Mongo `$lookup` can be expensive for large data sets.  
- Kafka join requires additional configuration (windowing or table/stream join).

**Cross-Database Operational Concerns**:

- JOINS in relational are straightforward but can become slow if unindexed.  
- `$lookup` in Mongo is not as optimized as typical relational joins.  
- Kafka join might need state stores, watch memory usage.

---

### **Operation: Schema Examination (information_schema vs. getCollectionInfos() vs. topic inspection)**

**Relational Approach (PostgreSQL):**

```sql
-- List tables in the current database
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public';
```

**Document Approach (MongoDB):**

```javascript
db.getCollectionInfos({ name: "customers" });
```

**Streaming Approach (Kafka):**

```bash
# List existing Kafka topics
kafka-topics --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --list
```

**Translation Notes**:

- SQL‚Äôs `information_schema` ‚Üí Mongo‚Äôs `getCollectionInfos()` ‚Üí Kafka‚Äôs `kafka-topics --list`.  
- Kafka ‚Äúschema‚Äù typically managed in Schema Registry if Avro/Protobuf used.

**Cross-Database Operational Concerns**:

- For large systems, these commands might produce big output.  
- Check permissions for each system‚Äôs metadata queries.

---

### **Operation: Monitoring Commands (Query inspection across systems)**

**Relational Approach (PostgreSQL):**

```sql
-- Show active queries
SELECT pid, query, state, query_start
FROM pg_stat_activity;
```

**Document Approach (MongoDB):**

```javascript
db.currentOp({ active: true });
```

**Streaming Approach (Kafka):**

```bash
# Check consumer group offsets and lag
kafka-consumer-groups --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
  --group my_consumer_group --describe
```

**Translation Notes**:

- **pg_stat_activity** vs. **currentOp** vs. **consumer groups** for seeing real-time usage.  
- Each system has unique performance metrics.

**Cross-Database Operational Concerns**:

- Overloading the monitoring queries themselves can cause overhead if done too frequently.  
- Use structured monitoring (e.g., Prometheus) for cross-system correlation.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Operational Differences Section

### 1. Connection & Authentication Models

- **Relational (Oracle/PostgreSQL/SQL Server)**: Usually a connection string (host, port, database, user, password).  
- **MongoDB**: Connection URI with potential replica set info.  
- **Kafka**: `bootstrap-server` addresses, SASL or SSL configurations.  
- **Pooling**: Each system handles multiple concurrent connections differently.  
- **Security**: E.g., PostgreSQL‚Äôs `pg_hba.conf`, Mongo‚Äôs SCRAM-SHA, Kafka‚Äôs SASL.

### 2. Monitoring & Observability

- **Key Metrics**:  
  - Relational: locks, slow queries, buffer cache.  
  - MongoDB: ops/sec, lock ratio, replication lag.  
  - Kafka: consumer lag, partition under-replicated.  
- **Tools**:  
  - Relational: `pg_stat_statements`, Oracle AWR, SQL Server DMVs.  
  - MongoDB: `mongostat`, `mongotop`.  
  - Kafka: built-in CLI tools, Confluent Control Center, JMX metrics.  
- **Cross-Database Challenges**: Aggregating metrics into a single SRE dashboard.

### 3. Backup & Recovery

- **Relational**: Full/incremental backups, point-in-time recovery (WAL logs).  
- **MongoDB**: `mongodump` / `mongorestore`, or filesystem snapshots, with replication for redundancy.  
- **Kafka**: Typically replicate logs across brokers. ‚ÄúBackups‚Äù might be exported or stored in external systems.  
- **RTO**: Each system differs. Kafka‚Äôs ‚Äúrecovery‚Äù might involve reprocessing logs.

### 4. Scaling & Performance

- **Relational**: Read replicas, partitioning, or clusters (Oracle RAC).  
- **MongoDB**: Horizontal sharding, replication sets.  
- **Kafka**: Add more brokers, partitioning.  
- **Performance Bottlenecks**:  
  - Relational: large joins, concurrency locks.  
  - MongoDB: unoptimized queries or large documents.  
  - Kafka: partition imbalance, slow consumers.

### 5. Failure Modes & Recovery

- **Relational**: Deadlocks, node crashes, cluster failover.  
- **MongoDB**: Primary node election in replica sets, shard misconfiguration.  
- **Kafka**: Leader partition failure, Zookeeper or broker downtime.  
- **Data Consistency**: Handling partial failures across multiple DB types can be complex.

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

Below are **9 FAQs** focused on cross-database topics:

### üîç FAQ #1

**Q**: When should I choose a relational database over MongoDB?  
**A**: If you need **strict ACID transactions**, complex joins, or strongly typed schemas, a relational DB is often more suitable. MongoDB can handle some transactions but is best for flexible, schema-evolving scenarios.

### üîç FAQ #2

**Q**: How do I manage skills for multiple databases at once?  
**A**: Start by **building on your SQL knowledge**, then learn equivalent concepts in MongoDB or Kafka. Use translation guides and practice real scenarios to reinforce cross-database thinking.

### üîç FAQ #3

**Q**: Is Kafka a replacement for a database?  
**A**: Typically **no**. Kafka is a **streaming platform** for real-time data pipelines and event processing. It doesn‚Äôt provide typical DB features like complex querying or random access. Use it alongside databases.

### üß© FAQ #4

**Q**: How difficult is it to replicate data from MongoDB to a relational DB (or vice versa)?  
**A**: It depends on **schema mapping**. Tools like **Kafka Connect**, `mongo-connector`, or custom ETL pipelines can help. You must carefully handle differences in data types and structure.

### üß© FAQ #5

**Q**: What are common pitfalls when implementing a streaming solution with Kafka?  
**A**: **Under-partitioning** leading to hotspots, ignoring **consumer lag**, poor offset management, or misunderstanding **exactly-once** semantics.

### üß© FAQ #6

**Q**: How does NoSQL handle indexing differently from relational databases?  
**A**: MongoDB indexes can be created on multiple fields, including geospatial. But there‚Äôs often no concept of a full ‚Äúprimary key + foreign key‚Äù system. Index strategies must be carefully planned to avoid huge overhead.

### üí° FAQ #7

**Q**: For high throughput, can a single PostgreSQL instance match a sharded MongoDB or large Kafka cluster?  
**A**: Possibly, but it becomes **complicated**. Often you‚Äôll need partitioning or a cluster solution. Sharded NoSQL or Kafka can scale horizontally more easily for certain workloads.

### üí° FAQ #8

**Q**: How do I monitor a multi-database environment effectively?  
**A**: Use a **centralized** metrics system (e.g., Prometheus + Grafana), collecting from each database‚Äôs metrics endpoints. Carefully design **dashboards** that correlate cross-system metrics (e.g., queue depth vs. DB concurrency).

### üí° FAQ #9

**Q**: How does SRE incident management differ in multi-database outages?  
**A**: You must check logs and metrics **across all systems**. A failure in one data store might cascade. Have separate runbooks for each DB, plus an overarching incident management plan that includes cross-team collaboration.

---

## üî• Multi-Database SRE Scenario

**Detailed Incident**: A large e-commerce application writes **orders** to PostgreSQL (for ACID compliance), **user sessions** to MongoDB (flexible schema), and **user activity** events to a Kafka topic for real-time analytics. Suddenly, the site slows to a crawl, and some sessions are randomly logging out.

### Steps (5‚Äì7 explicit actions)

1. **Check Active Sessions in MongoDB**  

   ```javascript
   db.currentOp({ active: true });
   ```

   - **Reasoning**: See if any queries or operations are stuck or if there‚Äôs a global lock.  
   - **SRE Principle**: Observability‚Äîunderstand live usage in the document store.

2. **Examine PostgreSQL Slow Queries**  

   ```sql
   SELECT pid, query, state, query_start
   FROM pg_stat_activity
   WHERE state = 'active';
   ```

   - **Reasoning**: Identify if order insert or update queries are delayed.  
   - **SRE Principle**: Reliability‚Äîensure orders are processed quickly.

3. **Inspect Kafka Consumer Lag**  

   ```bash
   kafka-consumer-groups --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
     --group analytics_consumer --describe
   ```

   - **Reasoning**: If the analytics pipeline is lagging, it could cause resource contention or slow user interactions in the microservices.  
   - **SRE Principle**: Performance‚Äîdetect if streaming backlogs are stressing the system.

4. **Correlate Mongo & PostgreSQL Through Logs**  
   - Compare timestamps of user session writes in Mongo with order commits in PostgreSQL.  
   - **Reasoning**: Possibly an event mismatch or partial transaction crossing systems.  
   - **SRE Principle**: End-to-end monitoring.

5. **Identify Root Cause**  
   - Suppose we discover a partial network outage between the microservice layer and Kafka brokers, causing timeouts.  
   - **Reasoning**: This leads to retries, increased load on the DB, and backpressure.  
   - **SRE Principle**: Incident triage‚Äîfix the network or redirect traffic.

6. **Resolve & Validate**  
   - Restore network connectivity or reconfigure broker addresses.  
   - Monitor session stability in Mongo, verify normal latencies in PostgreSQL, confirm consumer lag stabilizes.  
   - **SRE Principle**: Post-incident verification.

7. **Document in Runbook**  
   - Summarize root cause, steps taken, and any specific DB-level or Kafka-level settings changed.  
   - **SRE Principle**: Continuous improvement, knowledge sharing.
