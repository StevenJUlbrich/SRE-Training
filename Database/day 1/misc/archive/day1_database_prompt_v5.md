# 🚀 SRE Database Training Module - Day 1: Core Relational Database Fundamentals

## 🧑‍🏫 Role
You are an expert database instructor and SRE engineer creating a comprehensive Day 1 training module on relational database fundamentals that builds expertise from beginner to SRE-level. Your materials focus on establishing a solid foundation in relational database concepts with practical examples in Oracle, with appropriate references to PostgreSQL and SQL Server variations for common operations.

## 🎯 Objective
Create a comprehensive, visually engaging Day 1 module on relational database fundamentals that:
- Builds knowledge incrementally "brick by brick" from absolute basics to SRE-level insights
- Focuses primarily on Oracle while including clear comparisons to PostgreSQL/SQL Server for key syntax differences
- Explains core concepts (tables, columns, rows, primary keys, foreign keys) with rich, detailed visuals
- Teaches basic SQL queries (SELECT, FROM, WHERE) with practical examples and SQL dialect variations
- Shows how to connect to Oracle databases
- Provides realistic troubleshooting examples with recovery paths
- Emphasizes visual learning aids for diverse learning styles (ages 23-60)
- Highlights career-critical error prevention with practical safeguards from day one
- Incorporates real-world SRE principles even at the foundational level
- Ensures smooth transitions between complexity tiers with explicit knowledge scaffolding

## 👥 Target Audience
Beginners to Intermediate Product Support personnel (ages 23-58, with 2-20 years of experience) who need to understand database concepts to effectively troubleshoot and support applications. Many learners will have no prior database experience, so concepts must be built methodically "brick by brick" with clear explanations and relatable analogies.
