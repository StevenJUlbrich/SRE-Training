It may look “improper” at first glance because `\d customers` is **not standard SQL**—it’s actually a **psql (PostgreSQL client)** meta-command. In other words, `\d` only works inside the psql tool, so if you’re expecting a universal SQL statement (like `SELECT * FROM ...`) or an Oracle/SQL Server command (such as `DESC table` or `EXEC sp_columns tablename;`), the snippet can seem incorrect or incomplete. 

Here’s why that snippet was included and how it fits into the overall module:

1. **PostgreSQL-Specific Meta-Command**  
   - The command `\d table_name` is very convenient for quickly describing a table’s columns, indexes, and constraints in **PostgreSQL**. It’s intended for learners who are connecting with `psql` and want a fast way to see table definitions.  
   - Since Day 1 focuses primarily on **PostgreSQL**, the use of `\d` reflects the typical workflow in that environment.

2. **Not a Cross-Database SQL Statement**  
   - There is no *universal* ANSI SQL command for “describe table.” Each RDBMS tends to have its own approach. For example:  
     - **Oracle**: `DESC table_name;` (in SQL*Plus)  
     - **SQL Server**: `sp_help tablename;` or `EXEC sp_columns tablename;`  
     - **PostgreSQL (psql)**: `\d table_name`  
   - Because of these differences, a snippet that works in one environment (like psql) won’t necessarily work in Oracle’s `sqlplus` or SQL Server’s `sqlcmd`.

3. **In the Context of the Module**  
   - The training module’s theme was to show each concept primarily in **PostgreSQL**, and then **compare** the key differences to Oracle/SQL Server in separate tables or sections.  
   - That snippet was meant to illustrate how a **beginner** might verify a table’s structure quickly in a **PostgreSQL** environment. For Oracle or SQL Server, the module provides different examples (in the dialect-comparison sections) rather than trying to lump every meta-command variation into one snippet.

4. **If You Need an Equivalent Command**  
   - **Oracle**: 
     ```sql
     DESC customers;
     ```
   - **SQL Server**: 
     ```sql
     EXEC sp_columns customers;
     ```
   - Or, to see constraints in SQL Server:
     ```sql
     EXEC sp_help 'customers';
     ```
   - These commands achieve a similar result but differ from the psql meta-command.

5. **Why It Might Feel “Incomplete”**  
   - Since the snippet only showed `\d customers`, you might have expected a standard SQL statement that would work anywhere, or an explanation for Oracle/SQL Server. In the module’s “SQL Dialect Differences” sections, we focused on **common SQL statements** (`SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, etc.). For describing a table’s structure, there is no direct ANSI SQL equivalent, so each vendor’s client offers its own approach.
   - The module was trying to keep the **beginner example** concise. Overloading the snippet with all three RDBMS commands at once sometimes confuses early learners.

In short, the snippet isn’t “wrong” so much as **PostgreSQL-specific**. If you aren’t using psql (for instance, if you’re on Oracle), you’d use a different command. The Day 1 content is heavily PostgreSQL-focused with side-by-side comparisons for core SQL statements—but for meta-commands like describing a table, each database does it its own way. That’s the main reason it may appear that we “failed to generate proper information” if you were expecting a cross-database universal command.
