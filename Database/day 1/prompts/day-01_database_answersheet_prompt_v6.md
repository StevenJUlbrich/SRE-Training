## Oracle Focus Requirements

Ensure explanations focus on Oracle database concepts and include:

1. **Oracle-specific terminology and syntax** where applicable
2. **Oracle data dictionary views** relevant to the question topic
3. **Oracle tools** (SQL*Plus, SQL Developer, Enterprise Manager) where relevant
4. **Oracle performance monitoring approaches** for SRE-level questions
5. **Oracle vs. PostgreSQL/SQL Server differences** as comparison notes

## SRE Focus Requirements

For the SRE perspective section, include relevant insights about:

1. **Performance implications** of database design and query choices
2. **Reliability considerations** related to the question topic
3. **Monitoring approaches** using Oracle-specific tools and views
4. **Recovery strategies** where applicable to the question
5. **Scaling considerations** for enterprise database environments

## Mermaid Diagram Guidelines for Answer Explanations

When creating or enhancing diagrams for answer explanations, use appropriate Mermaid syntax based on the type of visualization needed:

1. **Entity-Relationship Diagrams** for database structure explanations:
```mermaid
classDiagram
  class Customers {
    +customer_id: number
    +name: string
    +email: string
  }
  class Orders {
    +order_id: number
    +customer_id: number
    +order_date: date
  }
  Customers "1" -- "n" Orders: places
```

2. **Flowcharts** for process explanations:
```mermaid
flowchart TD
  subgraph "Query Execution Process"
    A["Parse SQL"]
    B["Generate Execution Plan"]
    C["Execute Plan"]
    D["Return Results"]
  end
  A --> B
  B --> C
  C --> D
```

3. **Sequence Diagrams** for interaction explanations:
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Client
  participant Oracle DB
  participant Tablespace
  
  Client->>Oracle DB: SQL Query
  Oracle DB->>Tablespace: Read Data Blocks
  Tablespace-->>Oracle DB: Return Data
  Oracle DB-->>Client: Result Set
```

For all Mermaid diagrams, follow these formatting guidelines:

1. **Always enclose node labels in quotes** if they contain special characters or spaces
2. **Use self-closing `<br/>` tags** for line breaks in node labels
3. **Wrap subgraph titles in quotes**
4. **Place each connection on a separate line**
5. **Add nodes for text inside subgraphs** instead of raw text
6. **Keep diagrams simple and focused** on the concept being explained

Enhance diagram-based question explanations by:
1. Adding visual cues (colors, emphasizing specific elements)
2. Including before/after diagrams for comparative explanations
3. Showing potential issues and solutions visually
4. Illustrating database structure implications

You may need to make reasonable inferences about the correct answers based on database fundamentals and Oracle specifics if the quiz questions do not explicitly indicate the correct answer.
