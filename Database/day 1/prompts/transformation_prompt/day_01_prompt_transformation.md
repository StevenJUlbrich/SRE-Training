# üß† Prompt 1: *Follow-the-Sun Chronicles* Training Rewrite

> You're writing a technical training document as part of a serialized, character-driven series called **The Follow-the-Sun Chronicles**. Each day is led by a different fictional SRE character based in a different region of the world.
>
> For **Day 1**, your character is:
> - **Name:** Taylor  
> - **Location:** USA (East Coast)  
> - **Time:** 09:00 EST  
> - **Role:** New hire SRE, sharp but inexperienced, thrown into production on Day 1  
>
> Rewrite the **Day 1 SRE Database Training Module** as a narrative-driven, character-led experience. Taylor will be learning and teaching the material simultaneously‚Äîeverything from relational structure to basic SQL.  
>
> **Constraints and style:**
> 1. Preserve the **technical structure and concepts** from the original document: objectives, core concepts, support/SRE notes, SQL syntax, data dictionary examples, etc.
> 2. Introduce each section with **Taylor's perspective**, incorporating short narration, emotional reaction, or internal commentary.  
> 3. Use **Mermaid diagrams** wherever the original did.  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Use `&commat;` instead of `@` in all email addresses.  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Use `autonumber` for all `sequenceDiagram` blocks.  
> 4. Use **code blocks** for SQL snippets.  
> 5. Each concept section should contain:  
>    - Analogy for beginners  
>    - Mermaid diagram  
>    - SQL example(s)  
>    - Application for support/SREs  
> 6. Include one **sequenceDiagram** that shows a real-world SRE incident using Oracle performance views or `EXPLAIN PLAN`.
> 7. End with a **preview of Day 2**, where another character (Noah, based in Australia) will pick up the story.
>
> The tone should be:
> - Informal but accurate  
> - Slightly humorous but never dismissive  
> - Designed to teach through **storytelling, metaphor, and structured technical accuracy**  
>
> This is not a blog post or a screenplay. It's a **professional training module** told as a serialized SRE tale.

Use this prompt and feed it the original Day 1 material as background. Voil√†: you get Taylor, Mermaid charts, and the chaos of production queries all woven into your instructional design.
