# 🌐 Cross-Database Concepts Training Module  

**Bridging Relational, NoSQL, and Streaming Paradigms**  

---

## 📌 Introduction

Welcome to this comprehensive training module on **cross-database concepts**, designed as a follow-up to fundamental relational database training. Here, we’ll expand your perspective beyond traditional relational systems (Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQL Server) to encompass **NoSQL** (MongoDB) and **streaming** platforms (Kafka). Modern applications often use multiple database technologies together, so understanding how data concepts translate across paradigms is essential for Support and SRE roles alike.

### Why Multiple Database Types?

Contemporary systems handle diverse data patterns and performance demands. You might find:

- **Relational databases** for transactional consistency
- **NoSQL (document) stores** for flexible schemas and rapid development
- **Streaming platforms** for real-time event processing

A single application can incorporate all three, so being able to navigate these paradigms seamlessly is a **key skill** for today’s support and operations teams.

Below is a **visual paradigm map** illustrating the key players:

```text
   Relational DBs         Document/NoSQL       Streaming

   (Oracle,                (MongoDB)         (Kafka, KSQL)
    PostgreSQL,
    SQL Server)

   ┌─────────────┐        ┌─────────────┐        ┌─────────────┐
   │  Tables     │        │ Collections │        │   Topics    │
   │ (rows/cols) │  <-->  │ (docs/fields)  <-->  │ (messages)  │
   └─────────────┘        └─────────────┘        └─────────────┘
```

Many modern applications use:

- **Kafka** to ingest streaming events
- **MongoDB** to store flexible, rapidly changing data
- **PostgreSQL/Oracle/SQL Server** for highly structured, ACID-compliant transactions

Throughout this module, you’ll see how to **translate** familiar relational concepts into NoSQL and streaming equivalents, along with operational and SRE considerations.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. **Translate** fundamental relational data concepts to NoSQL (MongoDB) and streaming (Kafka) contexts.  
2. **Compare** and **contrast** core operations (e.g., data retrieval, filtering, aggregation) across relational, document, and streaming systems.  
3. **Assess** different consistency, scaling, and transaction models to troubleshoot multi-database architectures.  
4. **Apply** SRE principles of observability, reliability, and performance monitoring across heterogeneous database environments.  
5. **Diagnose** and **resolve** common cross-database issues involving data inconsistency, performance bottlenecks, and architectural mismatches.

## 🌉 Knowledge Bridge

Let’s **recap** the essential relational concepts from your previous training and show how they map to NoSQL and streaming:

- **Relational Concepts**  
  - Tables (rows, columns), primary/foreign keys, SQL queries (`SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`)
  - ACID transactions (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)

- **Core Translation**  
  - **MongoDB (Document)**: “Tables” → “Collections,” “Rows” → “Documents,” “Columns” → “Fields”  
  - **Kafka (Streaming)**: “Tables” → “Topics,” “Rows” → “Messages/Records,” “Columns” → “Message Fields/Keys”

| **System**   | **Core Unit**       | **Schema Rigor**      | **When to Use**                                 |
|--------------|---------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Relational   | Table → row/column | Strict schemas        | High data integrity, transactional workloads    |
| MongoDB      | Collection → doc   | Flexible JSON schema  | Rapid iteration, semi-structured data           |
| Kafka        | Topic → message    | Stream-based          | Real-time data ingestion, event-driven systems  |

**Strengths & Uses**  

- **Relational**: Best for structured data and transactions (OLTP).  
- **NoSQL (MongoDB)**: Great for fast iteration, unstructured/semi-structured data, massive read scalability.  
- **Streaming (Kafka)**: Real-time data pipelines, event processing, asynchronous communication.

## 📊 Database Paradigm Comparison Map

Below is a **side-by-side** comparison of the main paradigms. Notice how each system has different ways of storing data, enforcing schemas, and ensuring consistency.

| **Category**           | **Relational (PostgreSQL/Oracle/SQL Server)** | **Document (MongoDB)**                    | **Streaming (Kafka)**                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Structure**          | Tables, rows, columns, schemas                | Collections, documents, fields            | Topics, messages (key/value pairs), partitions        |
| **Schema Enforcement** | Strict (DDL defines schema)                   | Dynamic, schema can evolve                | Typically schema-less at core, optional schema via Avro|
| **Query Language**     | SQL (SELECT, JOIN)                            | MongoDB Query API (find, aggregation)     | Not a traditional “query”; we consume streams, possibly KSQL|
| **Consistency**        | ACID (varies by RDBMS)                        | Eventual or immediate (depending on config)| Messages are appended in order, exactly-once possible with config|
| **Scaling Model**      | Typically vertical or read replicas, some have sharding features | Horizontal with built-in sharding         | Horizontal scaling via partitions & consumer groups    |
| **Use Cases**          | Transactional, well-structured data, analytics | Flexible data structures, rapid changes    | Real-time event ingestion, distributed streaming       |

## 📚 Core Cross-Database Concepts

### 1. Data Structure Translation

#### **Relational Model → Document Model → Streaming Model**

- **Relational**:  
  - **Tables** with predefined columns (strict schema)  
  - **Rows** represent individual records  
  - **Schemas** separate logical groupings

- **Document (MongoDB)**:  
  - **Collections** roughly equate to tables  
  - **Documents** are JSON-like records with variable fields  
  - **Embedding** (nested docs) vs. **Referencing** (like foreign keys)

- **Streaming (Kafka)**:  
  - **Topics** store sequences of messages  
  - **Partitions** distribute messages for parallel consumption  
  - **Messages** can have a key, value, timestamp, etc.

🖼️ **Visual Representation**:

```text
  Relational (Table)       Document (Collection)       Streaming (Topic)
┌─────────────────────┐   ┌─────────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────────┐
│  Row1: col1, col2   │   │ Doc1: {field1, ...} │     │ Message1: Key,Value │
│  Row2: col1, col2   │   │ Doc2: {field2, ...} │     │ Message2: Key,Value │
└─────────────────────┘   └─────────────────────┘     └─────────────────────┘
```

🔬 **Technical Comparison**:  

- RDBMS requires rigid schema definitions. MongoDB’s schema is flexible, letting you add fields on the fly. Kafka focuses on streams (append-only logs) rather than structured queries.

💼 **Support/SRE Application**:  

- In **multi-database** setups, you’ll often map a relational table into a corresponding MongoDB collection or a Kafka topic for real-time replication or analytics.  
- Monitoring whether the structures align is key—e.g., watch for mismatch in field naming across systems.

🔄 **System Impact**:  

- Inconsistent data models lead to confusion and operational errors.  
- E.g., if you store “customer_id” as a string in MongoDB but as an integer in PostgreSQL, you can break transformations.

⚠️ **Common Misconception**:  

- “NoSQL means no schema.” In reality, schema still matters—just enforced differently (e.g., application logic or schema registries for Kafka).

📝 **Translation Pattern**:  

1. Identify the **table** in RDBMS.  
2. Create a **collection** in MongoDB with a similar naming convention.  
3. Set up a **topic** in Kafka reflecting the same domain entity.  
4. Align field names and types for consistency (either manually or via schema registry).

---

### 2. Query Operation Translation

- **Relational**: Standard SQL (`SELECT`, `JOIN`, `WHERE`).  
- **Document**: `db.collection.find()`, `$match`, `$project`, `$lookup` for doc references.  
- **Streaming**: Consumers reading messages, possibly using **KSQL** (Kafka SQL) or Spark Streaming for transformations.

🖼️ **Visual Representation**:

```text
    SELECT col FROM table          db.collection.find(...)          kafka-console-consumer ...
          (SQL)                          (Mongo)                            (Kafka)
```

🔬 **Technical Comparison**:  

- SQL is declarative and can handle complex joins out-of-the-box.  
- MongoDB has an extensive **aggregation pipeline**, but multi-document transactions are more limited than in relational DBs (though improved in recent versions).  
- Kafka typically deals with streaming transformations, either custom consumer code or KSQL, which has a SQL-like syntax for stream processing.

💼 **Support/SRE Application**:  

- Translating a query from SQL to Mongo’s aggregation might be needed if data is replicated from an RDBMS.  
- For real-time analytics, you might map a SQL `GROUP BY` to Kafka Streams or KSQL to do rolling aggregations over time windows.

🔄 **System Impact**:  

- Overly complex joins in MongoDB can degrade performance if you force multiple lookups.  
- Kafka’s streaming approach may require you to consider **stateful** stream processing for group-by or join-like operations.

⚠️ **Common Misconception**:  

- “Kafka queries data in real-time just like an RDBMS.” Actually, Kafka is an event log. You either build streams or use Kafka Connect and other frameworks to filter/transform data.

📝 **Translation Pattern**:  

1. Start with the **SQL** operation you know best.  
2. For MongoDB, break it down into a **find()** or an **aggregation pipeline** step for advanced queries.  
3. For Kafka, consider if you need a **consumer** (listening to messages) or a **stream processing job** (e.g., KSQL or a custom consumer app) to replicate the logic of a SQL filter or aggregation.

---

### 3. Consistency & Transaction Models

- **Relational (ACID)**: Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQL Server all provide strong consistency and multi-statement transactions (with isolation levels).  
- **Document (MongoDB)**: Single-document writes are atomic. Multi-document transactions exist (from 4.0+), but with certain performance trade-offs.  
- **Streaming (Kafka)**: Achieving “exactly-once” semantics involves idempotent producers, transactional topics, and careful offset management.

🖼️ **Visual Representation** (simplified):

```sql
 ┌───────────────────┐  ACID Guarantee
 │ RDBMS Transaction │--------------------------------───┐
 └───────────────────┘                                  |
                                                       | Possible partial doc commits
 ┌─────────────────────────┐   Single-Doc Atomicity    |
 │ MongoDB Multi-Document  │---------------------------┘
 └─────────────────────────┘

 ┌────────────────────────────┐  Offsets & Transaction Markers
 │ Kafka Producer + Consumer  │----------------------------------->  Exactly-Once Config
 └────────────────────────────┘
```

🔬 **Technical Comparison**:  

- **Relational**: Automatic rollback on failure, strict locks or MVCC.  
- **MongoDB**: Typically eventual consistency across replicas, though a single replica set can confirm writes.  
- **Kafka**: Doesn’t lock data the same way; concurrency is managed by partition offsets.

💼 **Support/SRE Application**:  

- Understanding how each system ensures or relaxes consistency is crucial when data must be **in sync** across multiple platforms.  
- E.g., an e-commerce order might be stored in Oracle for financial transactions, then streamed to Kafka for analytics, eventually arriving in MongoDB for a custom user dashboard.

🔄 **System Impact**:  

- RDBMS transactions can block if concurrency is high.  
- MongoDB can exhibit stale data if read from secondaries with eventual consistency.  
- Kafka might replay messages if consumer offsets are managed incorrectly.

⚠️ **Common Misconception**:  

- “MongoDB can’t do transactions.” Modern MongoDB can, but it’s not as mature in that area as a classic RDBMS.

📝 **Translation Pattern**:  

- For strict business rules or immediate consistency, keep transactions in the **relational** realm.  
- For flexible data or partial updates, use **MongoDB** with caution around multi-document transactions.  
- For real-time **event-driven** updates, use **Kafka** and design idempotent consumption logic if needed.

---

### 4. Scaling Approaches

- **Relational**:  
  - Vertical scaling common (beefier server), or read replicas.  
  - Sharding is possible but more complex (e.g., **PostgreSQL** native partitioning or Oracle RAC).  
- **Document (MongoDB)**:  
  - Built-in **horizontal scaling** through sharding.  
  - Automatic data distribution across cluster nodes.  
- **Streaming (Kafka)**:  
  - Topics partitioned across brokers.  
  - Consumer groups scale horizontally for parallel consumption.

🖼️ **Visual Representation**:

```sql
    Relational             MongoDB                  Kafka
      (RAC, replicas,        (Shards,                (Partitions,
     partitioned tables)   replica sets)          consumer groups)
```

🔬 **Technical Comparison**:  

- RDBMS scaling usually means bigger hardware or replication for reads. True multi-node writes can be more complex.  
- MongoDB shard keys automatically route inserts to the correct shard.  
- Kafka’s partition approach ensures each partition is processed by exactly one consumer in a group at a time, aiding concurrency.

💼 **Support/SRE Application**:  

- Know the **scaling constraints** of each database type to avoid bottlenecks.  
- In multi-database environments, you might rely on Kafka to ingest high-volume data, then push subsets into a relational store for critical transactions and into MongoDB for flexible queries.

🔄 **System Impact**:  

- Misconfigured shards or partitions can lead to data hotspots or unbalanced clusters.  
- Over-scaling can be expensive if you spin up too many brokers or shards.

⚠️ **Common Misconception**:  

- “Just shard everything.” Sharding adds operational complexity—only do it if the data volume or throughput demands it.

📝 **Translation Pattern**:  

1. Identify the scaling dimension (read vs. write).  
2. If high concurrency and flexible writes are needed, document DB or streaming might scale better.  
3. If strong transactional consistency with moderate data volume is enough, an RDBMS plus read replicas can suffice.  
4. Use **Kafka** to handle real-time ingestion and distribute workload to multiple consumers.

## 💻 Cross-Database Command & Query Translations

Below are **six** common operations, each shown in **relational**, **document**, and **streaming** forms.

---

### **Operation: Data Retrieval (basic read)**

**Relational Approach (PostgreSQL)**:

```sql
-- Example SQL operation
SELECT customer_id, first_name
FROM customers
WHERE customer_id = 123;
```

**Document Approach (MongoDB)**:

```javascript
// MongoDB find operation
db.customers.find(
  { customer_id: 123 },
  { first_name: 1, _id: 0 }
);
```

**Streaming Approach (Kafka)**:

```sql
# Kafka basic consumer reading from "customers" topic
kafka-console-consumer --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
  --topic customers \
  --from-beginning \
  --property print.key=true
```

**Translation Notes**:

- Relational SELECT specifically queries columns. MongoDB uses a projection to limit fields. Kafka “reading” typically means streaming messages from a topic; no column projection by default.

**Cross-Database Operational Concerns**:

- In Kafka, you receive **all** messages unless you have a filtering/stream-processing approach.  
- In MongoDB, if `customer_id` isn’t indexed, performance can suffer for large collections.

---

### **Operation: Filtering (WHERE → query operators → stream filtering)**

**Relational Approach (SQL Server)**:

```sql
SELECT order_id, amount
FROM orders
WHERE amount >= 1000
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

**Document Approach (MongoDB)**:

```javascript
db.orders.find(
  { amount: { $gte: 1000 } }
).sort({ created_at: -1 });
```

**Streaming Approach (Kafka KSQL)**:

```sql
-- KSQL example for filtering a stream
CREATE STREAM high_value_orders AS
SELECT order_id, amount
FROM orders_stream
WHERE amount >= 1000
EMIT CHANGES;
```

**Translation Notes**:

- **SQL** uses `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`.  
- **MongoDB** uses `$gte` for comparisons, `.sort()` for ordering.  
- **KSQL** can create a new stream with filtered messages.

**Cross-Database Operational Concerns**:

- Sorting in MongoDB may require an index on `created_at`.  
- KSQL queries are continuous; once set up, they keep filtering incoming messages.

---

### **Operation: Aggregation (GROUP BY → aggregation pipeline → stream processing)**

**Relational Approach (Oracle)**:

```sql
SELECT dept_id, COUNT(*) AS emp_count
FROM employees
GROUP BY dept_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10;
```

**Document Approach (MongoDB)**:

```javascript
db.employees.aggregate([
  { $group: { _id: "$dept_id", emp_count: { $sum: 1 } } },
  { $match: { emp_count: { $gt: 10 } } }
]);
```

**Streaming Approach (Kafka Streams / KSQL)**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE employee_counts AS
SELECT dept_id, COUNT(*) AS emp_count
FROM employees_stream
GROUP BY dept_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10
EMIT CHANGES;
```

**Translation Notes**:

- MongoDB `$group` is akin to SQL `GROUP BY`. `$match` after grouping is like `HAVING`.  
- Kafka/KSQL uses continuous aggregation; the table updates as new messages arrive.

**Cross-Database Operational Concerns**:

- In large RDBMS tables, grouping can cause significant CPU usage—indexes or partitioning help.  
- MongoDB’s pipeline can push data into memory for large groups.  
- KSQL must handle stateful aggregations over time windows or with indefinite state store requirements.

---

### **Operation: Relationships (JOIN → $lookup → stream joining)**

**Relational Approach (PostgreSQL)**:

```sql
SELECT e.emp_name, d.dept_name
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;
```

**Document Approach (MongoDB)**:

```javascript
db.employees.aggregate([
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "departments",
      localField: "dept_id",
      foreignField: "dept_id",
      as: "dept_info"
    }
  }
]);
```

**Streaming Approach (Kafka Streams / KSQL)**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees WITH (...);
CREATE TABLE departments WITH (...);

CREATE TABLE emp_dept AS
SELECT e.emp_name, d.dept_name
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
EMIT CHANGES;
```

**Translation Notes**:

- MongoDB `$lookup` is less efficient than a typical SQL join if large data sets are involved.  
- Kafka Streams join requires both streams or tables keyed properly by `dept_id`.

**Cross-Database Operational Concerns**:

- Relationship modeling is native in RDBMS; MongoDB typically **embeds** data to avoid frequent joins.  
- Kafka requires alignment of keys for real-time stream/table joins.

---

### **Operation: Schema Examination (information_schema → getCollectionInfos() → topic inspection)**

**Relational Approach (SQL Server)**:

```sql
SELECT TABLE_NAME, COLUMN_NAME, DATA_TYPE
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'customers';
```

**Document Approach (MongoDB)**:

```javascript
db.getCollectionInfos({
  name: "customers"
});
```

**Streaming Approach (Kafka)**:

```sql
# Inspecting existing topics (CLI)
kafka-topics --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --list

# Alternatively, describe a specific topic
kafka-topics --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --describe --topic customers
```

**Translation Notes**:

- Relational DBs store metadata in system catalogs or `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`.  
- MongoDB’s `getCollectionInfos()` reveals collection-level data.  
- Kafka’s CLI or admin commands show topic configuration, partitions, replication factor, etc.

**Cross-Database Operational Concerns**:

- In MongoDB, there’s no strict column definition.  
- In Kafka, “schema” might come from a Schema Registry if Avro or Protobuf is used.

---

### **Operation: Monitoring Commands (Query inspection across systems)**

**Relational Approach (PostgreSQL)**:

```sql
-- Checking active queries:
SELECT pid, usename, query, state
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE state = 'active';
```

**Document Approach (MongoDB)**:

```javascript
db.currentOp({ active: true });
```

**Streaming Approach (Kafka)**:

```sql
# Checking consumer lag with Kafka CLI
kafka-consumer-groups --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
  --group <consumer_group> \
  --describe
```

**Translation Notes**:

- RDBMS has various views (`pg_stat_activity`, Oracle’s V$SESSION).  
- MongoDB uses `currentOp()` to see in-progress operations.  
- Kafka consumer group commands show offsets, lag, etc.

**Cross-Database Operational Concerns**:

- Understanding how each system logs or exposes metrics is crucial for multi-database monitoring.  
- Be mindful of the overhead of real-time operation monitoring in production.

---

## 🛠️ Operational Differences Section

### 1. Connection & Authentication Models

- **Relational**: Typical connection strings (e.g., `jdbc:oracle:thin:@host:port:serviceName`). Authentication can use username/password, Kerberos, etc.  
- **MongoDB**: Connection URIs (e.g., `mongodb://user:pass@host/db`). Supports SCRAM, X.509, etc.  
- **Kafka**: Broker endpoints (host:port). SASL, SSL, or plaintext. Managing certificates is common in secure deployments.

### 2. Monitoring & Observability

- **RDBMS**: Tools like `pg_stat_statements`, Oracle Enterprise Manager, SQL Server Profiler. Common metrics: buffer hits, CPU usage, lock waits.  
- **MongoDB**: `mongostat`, `mongotop`, logs, Ops Manager. Key metrics: ops/sec, memory usage, replication lag.  
- **Kafka**: Broker JMX metrics, consumer lag, topic partitions usage. Tools: Confluent Control Center, Grafana dashboards.

### 3. Backup & Recovery

- **Relational**: Logical (pg_dump) or physical backups (RMAN for Oracle), point-in-time recovery logs.  
- **MongoDB**: `mongodump` for logical backups, file snapshots for consistent backups, or ops manager.  
- **Kafka**: Backups are tricky—often replicate clusters. Some use tiered storage or external archiving. Restoring an entire topic might involve re-ingesting from a backup cluster or storage.

### 4. Scaling & Performance

- **Relational**: Tends to scale vertically or with read replicas. Sharding is advanced.  
- **MongoDB**: Built for horizontal scaling, sharding is first-class.  
- **Kafka**: Partition-based horizontal scaling. Performance depends on cluster size, partition count, I/O throughput.

### 5. Failure Modes & Recovery

- **Relational**: Node failure can cause downtime unless a failover cluster or replication is in place.  
- **MongoDB**: Primary node failure triggers replica set election, potential downtime.  
- **Kafka**: Broker failure can be mitigated by replication factor; partition leadership moves to another broker.

## 🔨 Cross-Database Exercises

We have **3** hands-on exercises.

1. **Cross-Database Translation Exercise**
   - **Goal**: Convert a relational SQL query into MongoDB and Kafka operations.  
   - **Steps**:
     1. In a relational DB, run a query:  

        ```sql
        SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) AS total_spent
        FROM orders
        GROUP BY customer_id
        HAVING SUM(amount) > 1000;
        ```

     2. Translate to MongoDB’s aggregation pipeline with `$group` and `$match`.  
     3. Finally, imagine streaming events from a Kafka topic `orders` and use **KSQL** to group by `customer_id` and sum `amount`, filtering for totals above 1000.  
   - **Compare** results across all three to ensure logical equivalence.

2. **Multi-Database Diagnostic Scenario**
   - **Goal**: Troubleshoot a performance issue in an app using PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Kafka.  
   - **Steps**:
     1. Check active queries in PostgreSQL using `pg_stat_activity`.  
     2. Examine MongoDB logs via `mongotop` or `db.currentOp()`.  
     3. Measure Kafka consumer lag for the microservice reading from `orders` topic.  
     4. Identify which system’s latency is cascading and propose solutions (e.g., indexing in Mongo, optimizing Kafka partitioning, or rewriting slow SQL).

3. **System Selection Exercise**
   - **Goal**: Given a new feature requirement, decide which database type (or combination) is best.  
   - **Scenario**: The feature needs real-time event capture, flexible data storage for user-generated content, and eventual financial transaction logging with strong consistency.  
   - **Steps**:
     1. Propose how to integrate Kafka for ingesting events.  
     2. Decide if MongoDB or PostgreSQL is suitable for storing user data.  
     3. Justify how each choice meets reliability and performance needs.  
     4. Plan a monitoring strategy ensuring SRE-level coverage across all chosen databases.

## 🚧 Cross-Database Troubleshooting Scenarios

1. **Scenario: Cross-System Data Inconsistency**
   - **Symptom**: Data appears in MongoDB but not in the relational system.  
   - **Possible Causes**:  
     - Asynchronous replication from the relational DB to MongoDB.  
     - A failed ETL job or message queue backlog.  
     - Inconsistent or mismatched schema usage.  
   - **Diagnostic Approach**:  
     1. Check replication/ETL logs for errors.  
     2. Compare timestamps and identify last successful sync.  
     3. Validate data types in both systems.  
   - **Resolution Steps**:  
     - Fix broken replication pipeline or re-run the ETL for missing records.  
     - Standardize field types if mismatches are found.  
   - **Prevention**:  
     - Real-time monitoring of pipeline offsets or ETL job status.  
     - Automated schema validation.  

2. **Scenario: Performance Degradation in Hybrid Architecture**
   - **Symptom**: An application using PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Kafka experiences overall slowdown.  
   - **Possible Causes**:  
     - PostgreSQL locks piling up under heavy writes.  
     - MongoDB index build taking excessive time.  
     - Kafka broker under-provisioned, leading to high consumer lag.  
   - **Diagnostic Approach**:  
     1. Check each system’s performance metrics (CPU, locks, replication/lag).  
     2. Identify any correlated spikes across logs.  
     3. Evaluate query plans in PostgreSQL or large merges in MongoDB.  
   - **Resolution Steps**:  
     - Optimize or isolate slow queries.  
     - Scale Kafka partitions or upgrade hardware if needed.  
     - Create missing indexes in MongoDB.  
   - **Prevention**:  
     - Proactive capacity planning for each database.  
     - Load testing in a staging environment that mimics production.  

3. **Scenario: Data Migration Between Database Types**
   - **Symptom**: After migrating data from SQL Server to MongoDB, some fields are missing or inconsistent.  
   - **Possible Causes**:  
     - A script that only moved selected columns.  
     - Data type mismatch (e.g., integer vs. string).  
     - Overreliance on one-to-one table-to-collection mapping ignoring nested structures.  
   - **Diagnostic Approach**:  
     1. Compare row counts or record counts.  
     2. Check script logs for errors.  
     3. Validate sample documents in MongoDB to confirm presence of all fields.  
   - **Resolution Steps**:  
     - Correct the mapping script. Possibly embed related data in the same doc if that suits the new usage.  
     - Re-run partial migrations or do incremental updates.  
   - **Prevention**:  
     - Thorough testing in QA.  
     - Documenting a field-by-field mapping strategy.

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (9)

### 🟢 Cross-Database Basics

1. **Q**: **When should I choose a relational database over MongoDB?**  
   **A**: When data consistency, ACID transactions, and complex joins are a priority (e.g., financial systems). MongoDB is great for rapid schema changes or large-scale read/write patterns without heavy relational joins.

2. **Q**: **Is Kafka a replacement for a traditional database?**  
   **A**: No, Kafka is a streaming platform for real-time data. It’s not optimized for traditional storage or transactions. Often, data in Kafka is eventually stored in relational or NoSQL databases for long-term persistence.

3. **Q**: **How do I handle referencing data in MongoDB if there are no foreign keys?**  
   **A**: You can embed related data in documents or store references (e.g., store `author_id` in a blog post doc). However, referential integrity is enforced by your application rather than the database.

### 🟡 Operational & Migration

4. **Q**: **Do I need separate monitoring tools for each database system?**  
   **A**: Each system has its own native tools (e.g., `pg_stat_activity`, `mongostat`, Kafka’s consumer group CLI). Many third-party solutions (Prometheus, Datadog) integrate with multiple database types for unified dashboards.

5. **Q**: **What’s the easiest way to move data from a relational DB to Kafka in real time?**  
   **A**: Tools like **Kafka Connect** with JDBC source connectors can stream changes from relational databases into Kafka topics. The database must have change-data-capture features or a replication log.

6. **Q**: **How do I keep schema changes in sync between systems?**  
   **A**: Schema Registry for Kafka plus well-defined migrations in relational/Mongo. For multi-database updates, adopt a discipline of versioned migrations and test carefully in staging.

### 🔴 SRE-Level Strategy

7. **Q**: **How do we handle disaster recovery across multiple database systems?**  
   **A**: Each system (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Kafka) needs its own backup/replication strategy. For DR, ensure consistent points in time or at least well-documented restore processes that keep data in logical sync.

8. **Q**: **Can we have a single incident management approach for multi-database outages?**  
   **A**: Yes, but it must incorporate checks for each system’s health. Your runbooks should detail cross-system dependencies (e.g., what happens if Kafka is down but MongoDB is up?).

9. **Q**: **How do I build expertise in all these database technologies?**  
   **A**: Start from your strongest domain (often relational), then learn NoSQL/streaming fundamentals. Practice with lab setups, read official docs, and experiment with real-world mini-projects. Cross-training ensures better on-call readiness.

## 🔥 Multi-Database SRE Scenario

**Incident**: An e-commerce application experiences delayed order confirmations and missing dashboard updates. The app uses **PostgreSQL** (transactional orders), **MongoDB** (user-generated content, profiles), and **Kafka** (real-time analytics & notifications).

1. **Alarm Raised**: Users complain that after placing an order, the status page doesn’t update for several minutes.  
2. **Check PostgreSQL**:

   ```sql
   SELECT pid, query, state
   FROM pg_stat_activity
   WHERE state = 'active';
   ```

   - Observed multiple long-running transactions on `orders` table.  
   - SRE Principle: Validate that the DB is not deadlocked or overloaded.
3. **Check Kafka Consumer Lag**:

   ```javascript
   kafka-consumer-groups --bootstrap-server broker1:9092 \
     --group orderStatusUpdater \
     --describe
   ```

   - Lag is high for the `orders` topic. Means the `orderStatusUpdater` microservice is behind.  
4. **Check MongoDB**:

   ```javascript
   db.currentOp({ "secs_running": { $gt: 10 } });
   ```

   - Found some slow queries in `dashboardActivity` collection.  
5. **Diagnosis**: A surge of orders caused slower writes in PostgreSQL, creating a backlog in Kafka because the microservice that updates the status reads from a change stream. Meanwhile, the dashboard also queries MongoDB, which depends on timely processing of events from Kafka.  
6. **Resolution Steps**:
   - Scale out the `orderStatusUpdater` consumer (increase consumer group members).  
   - Optimize PostgreSQL transaction logic for shorter locks or batch commits.  
   - Add an index in MongoDB for the dashboard query if needed.  
   - Monitor concurrency across all three.  
7. **Aftermath**:  
   - Document the cross-database dependency in runbooks.  
   - Confirm stable throughput across each system.  
   - SRE Principle: Observability. Summarize in logs/dashboards for future load spikes.

**Key Lesson**: Even if one database is healthy, a queueing effect in Kafka can degrade overall user experience. Cross-database synergy is crucial for reliable microservices.
