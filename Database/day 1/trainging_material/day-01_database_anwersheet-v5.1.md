# Day 1 Database Answer Sheet

## Answer 1: Oracle Database Structure

üü¢ Beginner | Multiple Choice

**Question:**  
Which of the following best describes a **table** in an Oracle database?  
A. A collection of columns from multiple schemas  
B. A logical area used to store data files  
C. A structured set of rows and columns representing a single entity  
D. A user account that stores various database objects  

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**  
A table is fundamentally defined by rows and columns that together represent a single entity or dataset (e.g., employees, customers). In Oracle, a table belongs to a schema, and each row represents an individual record while each column describes an attribute of that record. Oracle stores metadata about these tables in data dictionary views such as `USER_TABLES` or `ALL_TABLES`, which helps the DBA or SRE manage schema objects. This structured approach is central to relational database design and data integrity.

**Why other options are incorrect:**  

- Option A: Columns from multiple schemas are not typically combined into a single table.  
- Option B: A logical area for data files in Oracle is called a tablespace, not a table.  
- Option D: A user account that stores objects is better referred to as a schema, not a table.

**Oracle Comparison Note:**  
In PostgreSQL and SQL Server, a table also represents rows and columns for a single entity, so the concept is nearly identical.

**Knowledge Connection:**  
This ties directly to the ‚ÄúRelational Database Structure‚Äù section from Day 1, covering the organization of data in Oracle.

**SRE Perspective:**  
Reliability depends on clearly structured data. A poorly designed table can harm performance and complicate troubleshooting.

**Additional Insight:**  
Be mindful of naming conventions in Oracle because object names can become confusing if you do not keep schemas, tables, and other database objects clearly differentiated.

## Answer 2: Basic SQL SELECT

üü¢ Beginner | Multiple Choice

**Question:**  
Which clause in a `SELECT` statement specifies the table from which data is retrieved?  
A. SELECT  
B. FROM  
C. WHERE  
D. ORDER BY  

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**  
The `FROM` clause indicates which table(s) or view(s) the query will read data from. In Oracle, you can specify multiple tables in the `FROM` clause and join them. Without a valid `FROM` clause (except in certain special cases like using `DUAL` for Oracle expressions), you cannot retrieve data from a table.

**Why other options are incorrect:**  

- Option A: `SELECT` specifies which columns (or expressions) to return, not which table.  
- Option C: `WHERE` is used for filtering rows.  
- Option D: `ORDER BY` is for sorting the result set.

**Oracle Comparison Note:**  
PostgreSQL and SQL Server also use the `FROM` keyword for specifying the data source.

**Knowledge Connection:**  
Relates to the ‚ÄúBasic SQL SELECT Statement‚Äù and ‚ÄúFROM Clause‚Äù sections, both fundamental to database querying.

**SRE Perspective:**  
Clear identification of the data source is crucial when troubleshooting performance issues or ensuring reliability. Misidentifying the table can lead to incorrect data or longer execution times.

**Additional Insight:**

## Answer 3: Primary & Foreign Keys

üü¢ Beginner | Multiple Choice

**Question:**  
Which statement about primary keys in Oracle is **true**?  
A. A table can have multiple primary keys  
B. A primary key column must contain unique and non-null values  
C. Primary keys are optional for table creation  
D. Primary keys automatically create foreign keys in another table  

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**  
In Oracle, a primary key is a constraint that ensures each row can be uniquely identified. By definition, the primary key cannot contain NULLs and must be unique across the table. This ensures data integrity and straightforward referencing by foreign keys.

**Why other options are incorrect:**  

- Option A: A table can only have one primary key constraint, although it may be a composite of multiple columns.  
- Option C: While technically you can create a table without a primary key, best practices (especially for SRE and operational integrity) strongly encourage having one for every transactional table.  
- Option D: Defining a primary key in one table does not automatically create foreign keys in other tables; foreign keys must be explicitly defined.

**Oracle Comparison Note:**  
Primary key rules are similar in PostgreSQL and SQL Server: unique and non-null constraints apply.

**Knowledge Connection:**  
This question relates to the ‚ÄúPrimary Keys and Foreign Keys‚Äù concept section, key to ensuring referential integrity.

**SRE Perspective:**  
A solid primary key structure supports reliability and performance because it optimizes lookups and helps avoid data inconsistency across systems.
