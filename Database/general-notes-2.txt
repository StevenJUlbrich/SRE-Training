Claude, I need to generate a new prompt for 

Day 7 Focus: Performance Tuning Fundamentals

Index types and structures
How indexes improve query performance
Execution plans and their interpretation
Basic query optimization strategies

Day 8 Focus: Advanced Performance Tuning & Monitoring

Query optimization beyond indexes
Database configuration parameters
Performance monitoring and metrics
Maintenance operations
Scaling strategies

Finalize schema following the structure and quality of the previous prompt I shared with you. 
The prompt is for generating the quiz and answer sheet material

Please:

Analyze the previous prompt's structure, formatting, and key components
Identify the important elements that made it effective (section organization, detail level, visual aids, etc.)
Create a new prompt for [specific topic] that maintains the same quality standards
Adapt any topic-specific sections while preserving the overall framework
Enhance areas that could be improved based on your analysis of previous outputs

Please pay special attention to:

Technical depth and practical examples
Visual representation requirements (like Mermaid diagrams)
The progression from beginner to advanced concepts
Real-world application scenarios
Formatting guidelines for consistent output

Use the 'Observe, Test, Evaluate, Act' approach to ensure the new prompt will produce results at least as good as the previous one."
This approach guides me to:

Systematically analyze what made the previous prompt effective
Maintain structural elements that worked well
Make appropriate adaptations for the new topic
Look for opportunities to improve based on previous outputs
Apply a methodical process to ensure quality and relevance
