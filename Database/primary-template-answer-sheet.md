## Special Considerations for [CHARACTER_NAME]'s Day [X] Material

When generating explanations, make sure to:

1. Reference [CHARACTER_NAME]'s personal anecdotes and realizations, such as:
   - [QUOTE_1]
   - [QUOTE_2]

2. Incorporate [CHARACTER_NAME]'s analogies:
   - [ANALOGY_1] for [CONCEPT_1]
   - [ANALOGY_2] for [CONCEPT_2]
   - [ANALOGY_3] for [CONCEPT_3]

3. Include [CHARACTER_NAME]'s SRE perspective on:
   - [SRE_POINT_1]
   - [SRE_POINT_2]
   - [SRE_POINT_3]

4. Reference specific database tools and views mentioned by [CHARACTER_NAME]:
   - [TOOL_1]
   - [TOOL_2]
   - [VIEW_1]
   - [VIEW_2]

For visual explanations, use Mermaid diagrams that resemble those in the original training material, especially:
- [DIAGRAM_TYPE_1] for [CONCEPT_1]
- [DIAGRAM_TYPE_2] for [CONCEPT_2]
- [DIAGRAM_TYPE_3] for [CONCEPT_3]

## Mermaid Diagram Guidelines for Answer Explanations

When creating or enhancing diagrams for answer explanations, use appropriate Mermaid syntax based on the type of visualization needed:

1. **Entity-Relationship Diagrams** for database structure explanations:
```mermaid
classDiagram
  class Table1 {
    +column1: datatype
    +column2: datatype
  }
  class Table2 {
    +column1: datatype
    +column2: datatype
  }
  Table1 "1" -- "n" Table2: relationship
```

2. **Flowcharts** for process explanations:
```mermaid
flowchart TD
  subgraph "Process Name"
    A["Step 1"]
    B["Step 2"]
    C["Step 3"]
    D["Step 4"]
  end
  A --> B
  B --> C
  C --> D
```

3. **Sequence Diagrams** for interaction explanations:
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Actor1
  participant Actor2
  participant System
  
  Actor1->>System: Action
  System-->>Actor1: Response
  Actor1->>Actor2: Communication
```

For all Mermaid diagrams, follow these formatting guidelines:
1. Always enclose node labels in quotes if they contain special characters or spaces
2. Use self-closing `<br/>` tags for line breaks in node labels
3. Wrap subgraph titles in quotes
4. Place each connection on a separate line
5. Add nodes for text inside subgraphs instead of raw text
6. Keep diagrams simple and focused on the concept being explained
