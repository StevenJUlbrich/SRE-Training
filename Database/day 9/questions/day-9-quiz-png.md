D. Data model changes require structured updates before insertion  

---

## Question 12: NoSQL Query Pitfalls  
üß© Intermediate-Level (Multiple Choice)

Chlo√© warns that using NoSQL improperly, like scanning entire data sets or performing large `$lookup` operations, can cause performance issues. Which practice is typically most efficient in a NoSQL context?

---

## Question 13: Weighted Decision Framework  
üß© Intermediate-Level (True/False)
