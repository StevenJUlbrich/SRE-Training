## Important Diagram Instructions

1. **Always preserve the original diagrams** exactly as they appear in the quiz questions
2. **For questions 14 and 18**, which already contain Mermaid diagrams, maintain the exact same diagram code in your answer explanations
3. **Add supplementary diagrams** in your explanations to help illustrate concepts when appropriate, such as:

   a. **SQL vs. NoSQL paradigm comparison**:
   ```mermaid
   flowchart LR
     subgraph "SQL"
       A["ACID<br/>Transactions"]
       B["Schema-on-Write"]
       C["Joins & Relationships"]
     end
     
     subgraph "NoSQL"
       D["BASE<br/>Properties"]
       E["Schema-on-Read"]
       F["Denormalized Data"]
     end
   ```

   b. **ACID vs. BASE transaction flow**:
   ```mermaid
   sequenceDiagram
     participant SQL as SQL Database
     participant NoSQL as NoSQL Database
     
     SQL->>SQL: Begin Transaction
     SQL->>SQL: Update Account A (-$100)
     SQL->>SQL: Update Account B (+$100)
     SQL->>SQL: Commit (All or Nothing)
     
     NoSQL->>NoSQL: Write to Node 1
     NoSQL-->>NoSQL: Eventually replicate to other nodes
     Note over NoSQL: Eventual consistency
   ```

   c. **Polyglot architecture event flow**:
   ```mermaid
   flowchart TB
     A["Source System<br/>(Oracle)"]
     B["Event Bus<br/>(Kafka)"]
     C["Target System<br/>(MongoDB)"]
     D["Analytics<br/>(Snowflake)"]
     
     A -->|CDC Events| B
     B -->|Consume| C
     B -->|Consume| D
   ```

   d. **Schema evolution comparison**:
   ```mermaid
   flowchart LR
     subgraph "Schema-on-Write"
       A["Structured Schema"]
       B["Formal Migration"]
       C["Data Always Consistent"]
     end
     
     subgraph "Schema-on-Read"
       D["Flexible Schema"]
       E["Interpret at Query Time"]
       F["Potential Inconsistencies"]
     end
   ```

## Database-Specific Focus Requirements

Ensure explanations focus on database architecture concepts and include:

1. **Database paradigm characteristics** for SQL and NoSQL systems
2. **Transaction model differences** between ACID and BASE approaches
3. **Schema design considerations** for different data models
4. **Consistency model trade-offs** and their operational implications
5. **Cross-database integration patterns** for polyglot architectures

## SRE Focus Requirements

For the SRE perspective section, include relevant insights about:

1. **Availability trade-offs** of different database paradigms
2. **Monitoring considerations** for multiple database environments
3. **Incident response strategies** for polyglot architectures
4. **Performance implications** of different data models
5. **Data consistency verification** approaches

You may need to make reasonable inferences about the correct answers based on database fundamentals and Day 9 concepts if the quiz questions do not explicitly indicate the correct answer.
