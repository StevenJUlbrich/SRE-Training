## Important Diagram Instructions

1. **Always preserve the original diagrams** exactly as they appear in the quiz questions
2. **For questions 8, 14, and 17**, which already contain Mermaid diagrams, maintain the exact same diagram code in your answer explanations
3. **Add supplementary diagrams** in your explanations to help illustrate concepts when appropriate, such as:

   a. **Hybrid architecture diagram**:
   ```mermaid
   flowchart LR
     A["App Services"] -->|Writes| O["Oracle"]
     A -->|Reads/Writes| C["Cassandra"]
     O -->|CDC Events| K["Kafka"]
     K -->|Consuming| D["DynamoDB"]
     K -->|Analytics| S["Spark"]
   ```

   b. **Monitoring flow diagram**:
   ```mermaid
   flowchart TB
     DB1["Oracle"] --> Prom["Prometheus"]
     DB2["Cassandra"] --> Prom
     DB3["Kafka"] --> Prom
     Prom --> Graf["Grafana Dashboards"]
     Graf --> Alert["Alertmanager"]
     Alert --> Notify["SRE Notification"]
   ```

   c. **Production-readiness flowchart**:
   ```mermaid
   flowchart TB
     A["Proposal: New DB"] --> B{"Backup Strategy?"}
     B -->|Yes| C{"Restore Drill?"}
     B -->|No| F["Not Production Ready"]
     C -->|Yes| D{"Monitoring?"}
     C -->|No| F
     D -->|Yes| E["Production Ready"]
     D -->|No| F
   ```

   d. **Incident sequence diagram**:
   ```mermaid
   sequenceDiagram
     participant SRE as SRE Team
     participant Oracle as Oracle DB
     participant Kafka as Kafka
     participant NoSQL as NoSQL DB
     
     SRE->>Oracle: Verify commits
     Oracle-->>SRE: Success
     SRE->>Kafka: Check consumer lag
     Kafka-->>SRE: 50K lag
     SRE->>NoSQL: Data check
     NoSQL-->>SRE: Missing data
     SRE->>Kafka: Restart consumer
     Note over SRE,NoSQL: Data begins to sync
   ```

## Database-Specific Focus Requirements

Ensure explanations focus on multi-database architecture concepts and include:

1. **Characteristics and trade-offs** of various database technologies
2. **Integration patterns** between different database systems
3. **Monitoring approaches** for polyglot architectures
4. **Backup and recovery considerations** for diverse database environments
5. **Failure modes and debugging strategies** across multiple systems

## SRE Focus Requirements

For the SRE perspective section, include relevant insights about:

1. **Observability practices** for multi-database environments
2. **Incident response strategies** for polyglot architectures
3. **Performance and reliability trade-offs** between different database solutions
4. **Capacity planning and scaling considerations** for hybrid systems
5. **Production readiness assessment** techniques

You may need to make reasonable inferences about the correct answers based on database fundamentals and Day 10 concepts if the quiz questions do not explicitly indicate the correct answer.
