A. Immediately locking out all developers from the database  
B. Enforcing regular audits of role inheritance to spot over-privileged stacks

D. `DROP ROLE reporting_role;`

---

### 10. [Multiple Choice] Rule #2: Documentation & Justification  
🧩 Intermediate

Fatima’s Rule #2 states: “All privileges must be documented, justified, and regularly audited.” How does she recommend fulfilling this rule effectively?

A. Rely solely on memory for which privileges have been granted  
B. Maintain a simple text file listing user privileges, updated monthly  
C. Employ a structured audit trail (e.g., a table or system logs) that automatically tracks GRANT/REVOKE activities  
D. Only track privileges for superuser roles, ignoring read-only accounts

---

### 11. [Ordering] Responding to Revoked Permissions Incident  
🧩 Intermediate

Arrange the following steps in the correct order, according to Fatima’s typical approach when discovering a critical user lost needed privileges:

A. Investigate logs to confirm which statement removed the privileges  
B. Re-grant the lost privileges immediately to restore service  
C. Document the privilege change for future audits  
D. Discuss root cause and prevention measures with the team

---

### 12. [True/False] Impact of Broad Permissions on Performance  
🧩 Intermediate

Statement: Fatima says that granting broad system privileges to novices can lead to performance chaos if they run massive or unbounded queries.

A. True  
B. False

---

### 13. [Fill-in-the-Blank] Fatima’s Rule #3  
🧩 Intermediate

---

### 18. [Matching] Fatima’s Rules in Action  
💡 Advanced

Match each situation to the corresponding Fatima Rule.

**Column A (Situations)**

2. A read-only user unexpectedly loses SELECT on a critical table, causing an outage.  
3. No logs exist to track when or how privileges were granted.  
4. Roles are left untouched for years, and some old test accounts remain active.

**Column B (Rules)**  
A. “Regularly audit your fortress. Over-privileged, inactive, or nonsensical roles are meltdown invites.”  
B. “All privileges must be documented, justified, and regularly audited.”  
C. “Always prefer object-specific keys over system master keys. Fewer meltdown vectors, less havoc.”  
D. “Over-privileged accounts aren’t just a security hazard; they can strangle performance.”
