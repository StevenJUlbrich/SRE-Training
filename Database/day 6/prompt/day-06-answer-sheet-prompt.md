## Database Focus Requirements

Ensure explanations focus on database-specific concepts and include:

1. **User management implementation details** across different database systems
2. **Permission model specifics** in Oracle, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server
3. **Security best practices** for user and permission management
4. **Availability and performance consideration details** from an SRE perspective
5. **Differences between Oracle, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server** in user and permission management
6. **Database-specific security features and limitations** for different database systems

## SRE Focus Requirements

For the SRE perspective section, include relevant insights about:

1. **Security implications** of different permission models and configurations
2. **Availability considerations** related to user management and authentication systems
3. **Performance impacts** of different permission checking mechanisms
4. **Monitoring approaches** for user activity and permission-related issues
5. **Incident response strategies** for security, availability, and performance issues
6. **High availability strategies** for authentication and authorization systems

## Mermaid Diagram Considerations

For questions that reference or relate to Mermaid diagrams from the training:

1. **Diagram interpretation** - Explain how to interpret the visual elements correctly
2. **Permission hierarchy visualization** - Clarify how different permission relationships appear in diagrams
3. **User role relationship visualization** - Explain how to interpret user-role relationship diagrams
4. **Common diagram mistakes** - Note typical errors in diagramming permission hierarchies or user relationships

## Mermaid Diagram Generation Guidelines

When creating explanations that involve Mermaid diagrams or when referring to diagrams, follow these formatting rules to ensure proper rendering:

1. **Always Enclose Node Labels in Quotes**
   * If a node label has **parentheses** `( )`, **colons** `:`, or **HTML tags** like `<br/>`, wrap it in quotes:
   ```
   A["Database Administrator"]
   B["User: ReadOnly"]
   C["Line1<br/>Line2"]
   ```

2. **Use Self-Closing `<br/>` Tags**
   * For line breaks in node labels, use `<br/>` (with a slash) instead of `<br>`.
   * Keep them inside quotes: `["Line1<br/>Line2"]`.

3. **Subgraph Titles**
   * Always wrap subgraph titles in quotes:
   ```
   subgraph "Database Users"
     U1["Admin User"]
     U2["Read-Only User"]
   end
   ```

4. **Use Separate Lines for Each Arrow or Connection**
   * Place each connection on its own line:
   ```
   A --> B
   B --> C
   ```
   * Avoid: `A --> B --> C`

5. **No Raw Text Immediately After `subgraph`**
   * Add nodes for text inside subgraphs instead of raw text:
   ```
   subgraph "User Hierarchy"
     N["User types diagram"]
   end
   ```

6. **Avoid Ambiguous Characters in the Flow**
   * Keep characters like `#`, `?`, or additional punctuation inside quotes if needed.

7. **Simplify Complex Diagrams**
   * Break down complex relationships into simpler sections.
   * Test diagrams incrementally to ensure proper rendering.

Example of a correctly formatted Mermaid diagram for explaining a permission hierarchy answer:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  subgraph "User Hierarchy"
    A["Database Administrator"]
    B["Power User"]
    C["Regular User"]
    D["Read-Only User"]
  end
  
  subgraph "Permission Flow"
    P1["System Privileges"]
    P2["Object Privileges"]
    P3["Data Access"]
  end
  
  A --> P1
  A --> P2
  A --> P3
  B --> P2
  B --> P3
  C --> P3
  D -->|"SELECT only"| P3
```

## Final Document Format Requirements

Generate a single Markdown document with the **full question text** followed by its **answer** and **explanation**, from Question 1 to Question 20. **Do not** create a separate section listing all 20 questions at the start. Instead, for each question:

1. Show the **question number** and **topic** (e.g., `[User Management]`),
2. Then **restate** just that one question's text,
3. Provide the **correct answer** label (e.g., A, B, C, D, or True/False, etc.),
4. **Explain** the reasoning in detail.

**Do not** produce a separate "Questions" section before the answer sheet. The deliverable is a single sequence of 20 entries, each containing the question's text and the associated answer/explanation.

Remember to observe, test, evaluate and take action when explaining answers to create comprehensive and educational responses. Apply the OTEA approach to each question's explanation:
- **Observe**: Identify the key concept being tested
- **Test**: Apply the correct reasoning to find the answer
- **Evaluate**: Consider why other options are incorrect or less optimal
- **Act**: Provide actionable insights that extend beyond the question

## Invocations Statement
Generate a comprehensive answer sheet for the Day 6 database training quiz questions on Basic Database Administration focused on user accounts, permissions/privileges, and the SRE perspective on database availability and performance. For each question, provide the correct answer with detailed explanations, reasons why incorrect options are wrong, comparisons between different database systems where relevant, connections to Day 6 material, SRE perspectives on security, availability, and performance, and additional practical insights.

Focus on explaining user management concepts, permission models, security best practices, and SRE perspectives on database administration. Cover user account creation, permission granting (including read-only vs. read/write access implementation), role-based access control, and the principles of least privilege. Include detailed explanations of why database availability and performance are critical from an SRE perspective, including monitoring approaches, reliability strategies, and incident response.

Apply the "Observe, Test, Evaluate, Act" approach to each answer to create thorough and educational responses. Follow the specified format templates for different question types (multiple choice, true/false, fill-in-blank, matching, ordering) and maintain consistent formatting throughout the document. Follow the Mermaid diagram formatting guidelines when creating or referencing diagrams in answer explanations to ensure proper rendering. The final document should present questions and answers in sequence without a separate questions section at the beginning.
