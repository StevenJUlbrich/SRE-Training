## Mermaid Diagram Generation Guidelines

When creating Mermaid diagrams for the training module, follow these formatting rules to ensure proper rendering:

1. **Always Enclose Node Labels in Quotes**
   * If a node label has **parentheses** `( )`, **colons** `:`, or **HTML tags** like `<br/>`, wrap it in quotes:
   ```
   A["Database Administrator"]
   B["User: ReadOnly"]
   C["Line1<br/>Line2"]
   ```

2. **Use Self-Closing `<br/>` Tags**
   * For line breaks in node labels, use `<br/>` (with a slash) instead of `<br>`.
   * Keep them inside quotes: `["Line1<br/>Line2"]`.

3. **Subgraph Titles**
   * Always wrap subgraph titles in quotes:
   ```
   subgraph "Database Users"
     U1["Admin User"]
     U2["Read-Only User"]
   end
   ```

4. **Use Separate Lines for Each Arrow or Connection**
   * Place each connection on its own line:
   ```
   A --> B
   B --> C
   ```
   * Avoid: `A --> B --> C`

5. **No Raw Text Immediately After `subgraph`**
   * Add nodes for text inside subgraphs instead of raw text:
   ```
   subgraph "User Hierarchy"
     N["User types diagram"]
   end
   ```

6. **Avoid Ambiguous Characters in the Flow**
   * Keep characters like `#`, `?`, or additional punctuation inside quotes if needed.

7. **Simplify Complex Diagrams**
   * Break down complex relationships into simpler sections.
   * Test diagrams incrementally to ensure proper rendering.

## Mermaid Diagram Specifications

For each type of diagram in the training module, follow these guidelines:

1. **User Management Diagrams**
   * Use Mermaid's flowchart syntax to show user types, roles, and permissions
   * Include sample user hierarchies and their relationships to database objects
   * Use color coding or visual cues to indicate permission levels
   * Example:
   ```
   ```mermaid
   flowchart TD
     subgraph "Database Users"
       DBA["Database Administrator"]
       PowerUser["Power User"]
       RegularUser["Regular User"]
       ReadOnlyUser["Read-Only User"]
     end
     
     subgraph "Permission Levels"
       P1["Full Control"]
       P2["Write Access"]
       P3["Read Access"]
       P4["No Access"]
     end
     
     DBA --> P1
     PowerUser --> P2
     RegularUser --> P3
     ReadOnlyUser --> P3
   ```
   ```

2. **Permission Hierarchy Visualization**
   * Use Mermaid's flowchart syntax to represent permission inheritance and relationships
   * Show how roles and permissions interact
   * Include example users and their effective permissions
   * Example:
   ```
   ```mermaid
   flowchart TD
     subgraph "Roles"
       R1["Administrator Role"]
       R2["Developer Role"]
       R3["Analyst Role"]
       R4["Reader Role"]
     end
     
     subgraph "Permissions"
       P1["CREATE ANY TABLE"]
       P2["ALTER ANY TABLE"]
       P3["SELECT ANY TABLE"]
       P4["INSERT ON tables"]
       P5["UPDATE ON tables"]
     end
     
     R1 --> P1
     R1 --> P2
     R1 --> P3
     R1 --> P4
     R1 --> P5
     R2 --> P3
     R2 --> P4
     R2 --> P5
     R3 --> P3
     R3 --> P4
     R4 --> P3
   ```
   ```

3. **SRE Monitoring Workflow**
   * Use Mermaid's flowchart syntax with process nodes
   * Include monitoring, alerting, and response steps
   * Use consistent notation and clear relationships
   * Example:
   ```
   ```mermaid
   flowchart TD
     A["Database Metrics<br/>Collection"] --> B["Metrics Storage"]
     B --> C["Monitoring Dashboard"]
     C --> D{"Threshold<br/>Exceeded?"}
     D -->|Yes| E["Alert Triggered"]
     D -->|No| C
     E --> F["Incident Response"]
     F --> G["Remediation Steps"]
     G --> H["Post-Incident Review"]
     H --> I["Process Improvement"]
     I --> A
   ```
   ```

4. **Database Availability Architecture**
   * Use Mermaid's flowchart or graph syntax for architectural visualizations
   * Include primary and standby components
   * Show data flow and replication paths
   * Example:
   ```
   ```mermaid
   flowchart LR
     subgraph "Primary Data Center"
       P["Primary Database"]
       PA["Application Servers"]
       PA --> P
     end
     
     subgraph "Standby Data Center"
       S["Standby Database"]
       SA["Standby App Servers"]
     end
     
     P -->|"Synchronous<br/>Replication"| S
     
     F["Load Balancer"] --> PA
     F -.->|"Failover"| SA
     SA -.->|"Failover"| S
   ```
   ```

Ensure all diagrams:
* Have clear titles
* Use consistent notation throughout
* Include legends where appropriate
* Are properly formatted with the ```mermaid syntax
* Enhance rather than duplicate the text content
