## ✅ Formatting Requirements

* Use emojis consistently to highlight sections and tiers (🔍 Beginner, 🧩 Intermediate, 💡 Advanced/SRE).
* Create clear **Mermaid diagrams** following these guidelines:
  - Wrap node labels containing parentheses or colons in quotes.

  - Clearly label subgraphs and nodes.
  - Keep diagrams concise and incrementally test them.

* Format tables with consistent column alignment.
* Use consistent markup for code blocks.
* Provide transitions between sections for logical reading flow.


## Mermaid Diagram Generation Guidelines

When creating diagrams for the training module:

1. **Enclose Node Labels in Quotes** if they contain special characters like `()`, `:`:
   ```mermaid
   A["CREATE USER statement"] --> B["GRANT privileges"]
   ```
2. **Use Self-Closing `<br/>` Tags**:
   ```mermaid
   T1["Username: admin<br/>Host: localhost"]
   ```
3. **Subgraph Titles** in quotes:
   ```mermaid
   subgraph "User Management Flow"
     S1["User Creation"]
     S2["Assign Role"]
   end
   ```
4. **Separate Lines for Arrows**:
   ```mermaid
   A --> B
   B --> C
   ```
5. **No Raw Text Immediately After `subgraph`**:
   ```mermaid
   subgraph "DB Admin Process"
     N["Step 1: Create User"]
   end
   ```
6. **Avoid Ambiguous Characters** in node labels.
7. **Keep Complex Diagrams Manageable** by breaking them into smaller segments.
