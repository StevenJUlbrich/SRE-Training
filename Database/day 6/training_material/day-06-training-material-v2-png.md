# üîê SRE Database Training Module ‚Äî Day 6: Basic DB Admin (User Accounts, Permissions & SRE Perspective)
  
## 1. üìå Introduction

Welcome to Day 6 of your database training! Today‚Äôs focus is on **Basic Database Administration** and how it ties into **SRE principles** of availability and performance.

### Observe, Test, Evaluate, and Take Action
- **Observe**: Inspect user accounts, roles, and permission structures in the database.
- **Test**: Confirm how permissions behave when applied to different users.
- **Evaluate**: Measure the impacts of these permissions on both security and performance.
- **Take Action**: Adjust permissions, roles, and user configurations to optimize database security and availability.

### Why User Management Matters
- **Security & Governance**: Proper user management prevents unauthorized data access and ensures compliance with legal and organizational mandates.
- **Accountability**: Tracing issues back to specific user accounts or roles is critical for audits and post-incident reviews.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Efficient permission structures reduce time spent troubleshooting access issues.

### Real-World Support Scenario
Picture a high-traffic web application that experiences sudden read failures. Upon investigation, you discover the read-only service account no longer has `SELECT` privileges on key tables. This single permissions oversight can cause large-scale outages, demonstrating the importance of systematic user and permission management.

### SRE Perspective on Availability & Performance
- Databases are often the ‚Äúsingle source of truth.‚Äù Downtime or poor performance has a **direct impact** on users.
- SREs monitor metrics like connection utilization, query response times, and resource consumption to ensure smooth operations.
- Permissions can impact performance if misapplied (e.g., a read-only user unexpectedly running resource-heavy updates).

Below is a **high-level concept map** illustrating the relationship between users, permissions, database objects, and reliability:

## 3. üìö Core Concepts

Each concept below includes a **Beginner Analogy**, a **Visual Representation**, a **Technical Explanation**, a **Support/SRE Application**, **System Impact**, **Common Misconceptions**, and **Database Implementation** details.

### Example: Permissions (System vs. Object Privileges)

1. **Beginner Analogy**  
   - **System privileges** are like having the key to the entire building (you can manage infrastructure-level features).  
   - **Object privileges** are like having a key to a single office or room.

2. **Visual Representation**  
   

![Mermaid Diagram: flowchart](images/diagram-2-f18aa5ea.png)



3. **Technical Explanation**  
   - **System privileges** allow actions like creating databases, managing schemas, or controlling critical system-level configurations.  
   - **Object privileges** regulate access to specific objects (tables, views, procedures, etc.) with `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and so on.

4. **Support/SRE Application**  
   - Improper system privileges can lead to catastrophic errors (e.g., dropping entire databases).
   - Object privileges usually cause day-to-day ticket volumes (e.g., user can‚Äôt read a table).

5. **System Impact**  
   - Overly broad privileges risk security breaches and data corruption.
   - Too little privilege hampers troubleshooting and application functionality.

6. **Common Misconceptions**  
   - ‚ÄúGranting all privileges is faster than being selective.‚Äù This leads to enormous security risks.
   - ‚ÄúObject privileges never impact performance.‚Äù Actually, poorly organized permissions can create confusion and hamper user efficiency.

7. **Database Implementation**  
   | Database | System Privilege Example        | Object Privilege Example   |
   |----------|---------------------------------|----------------------------|
   | Oracle   | `CREATE USER`, `SYSDBA`         | `SELECT ON employees`      |
   | Postgres | Superuser role                  | `SELECT, INSERT ON TABLE`  |
   | SQL Server | `CONTROL SERVER`               | `SELECT ON dbo.Employees`  |

## 4. üíª Day 6 Concept Breakdown

Below is a deeper look at our **Day 6** topics, each structured with an overview, analogy, mermaid diagram, technical details, tiered examples, and pitfalls.

### 4.1 Database User Management Fundamentals
- **Concept Overview**: Establishes authentication (who you are) and authorization (what you can do).
- **Analogy**: Think of ‚Äúfront desk registration‚Äù in an office, ensuring only verified staff get ID badges.
- **Mermaid Diagram**:

  

![Mermaid Diagram: flowchart](images/diagram-3-509c4964.png)


- **Technical Details**: 
  - Each user has unique credentials.  
  - Databases often store user info in system tables or use external authentication (LDAP, Kerberos).
- **Tiered Examples**:  
  - üîç *Beginner*: Creating a single user with minimal privileges.  
  - üß© *Intermediate*: Setting up multiple users and controlling their privileges through roles.  
  - üí° *SRE*: Integrating with external identity management for streamlined authentication across multiple servers.
- **Pitfalls**:  
  - Failing to disable old user accounts leads to security holes.
  - Overlooking password complexity settings or rotation policies.

### 4.2 Creating and Managing Database Users
- **Syntax & Best Practices**:
  - Oracle: `CREATE USER john IDENTIFIED BY strongPass123;`
  - Postgres: `CREATE ROLE john WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'strongPass123';`
  - SQL Server: `CREATE LOGIN John WITH PASSWORD = 'strongPass123'; CREATE USER John FOR LOGIN John;`
- **Lifecycle Management**:
  - Incorporates creation, password resets, user lockouts, and eventual removal or disabling.

### 4.3 Roles and Privileges
- **Predefined Roles**: Oracle‚Äôs `CONNECT`, `RESOURCE`, `DBA`; Postgres‚Äôs `pg_read_all_data`, etc.
- **Custom Roles**: Assign only the privileges your specific environment needs.

### 4.4 System vs. Object Privileges
- Detailed in **Core Concepts** (Section 3 example).

### 4.5 GRANT and REVOKE Commands
- **Syntax**  
  - Oracle/Postgres: `GRANT privilege ON object TO user;`  
  - SQL Server: `GRANT SELECT ON dbo.Employees TO [Domain\User];`  
- **Scope**: May grant single privileges or role-based sets of privileges.
- **Cascading Effects**: Revoking a role can remove privileges from all assigned users.

### 4.6 Read vs. Write Permissions
- **Least Privilege**: Grant only required privileges for the user‚Äôs business function.
- **Example**: Give marketing analysts read-only access to sales data, but not write or update access.

### 4.7 Database Security Best Practices
- **Password Policies**: Enforce complexity, length, and rotation schedules.
- **Auditing**: Track DDL and DML changes, logon attempts, and suspicious queries.
- **Encryption**: Use data-at-rest (tablespace encryption) and data-in-transit (TLS) security.

### 4.8 Monitoring User Activity
- **Logging & Auditing**: Identify anomalies like logins at unusual hours or repeated authentication failures.
- **Alerting**: SRE principle to ensure immediate notifications if suspicious behavior occurs.

### 4.9 SRE Perspective: Database Availability
- **Why It Matters**: Outages affect user experience and revenue.
- **Common Challenges**: Hardware failure, network issues, misconfigured roles causing system errors.
- **Strategies**: Implement replication, clustering, or failover solutions.

### 4.10 SRE Perspective: Database Performance
- **Performance Metrics**: Query latency, throughput, CPU and memory usage, I/O stats.
- **Monitoring**: Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, CloudWatch, or built-in DB performance views.
- **Optimization**: Indexing, caching, query rewrites, connection pooling.

## 5. üîÑ Permission Management Process in Practice

### Decision Framework
1. **Identify** user needs.
2. **Determine** the minimal set of privileges.
3. **Implement** privileges via direct grants or roles.
4. **Review** permissions regularly for revocation or adjustment.

### Visual Workflow


![Mermaid Diagram: flowchart](images/diagram-4-64b10434.png)



### Common Pitfalls
- Granting high-level roles (like `DBA` or `superuser`) for convenience.
- Forgetting to test user permissions before deployment.

### Verification Techniques
- **Check Effective Privileges**: `SHOW GRANTS` (MySQL), `\du` (Postgres), or system views in Oracle/SQL Server.
- **Attempt Role-Specific Tasks**: Log in as the user and test commands.

---

## 6. üõ†Ô∏è SRE Practices for Database Reliability

### Key Availability Metrics
- **Uptime Percentage**: e.g., 99.9% or 99.99% Service Level Objective (SLO).
- **Replication Lag**: Time difference in transactional states between primary and standby.
- **Mean Time to Detect/Recover (MTTD/MTTR)**: How quickly the team recognizes and fixes issues.

### Common Availability Challenges
- **Single Points of Failure**: Lack of redundancy in hardware or services.
- **Long-running Transactions**: Cause blocking and potentially crash failover systems.
- **Human Error**: Misconfiguration, accidental privilege revocations.

### High Availability Architectures
- **Primary-Standby** (Synchronous or Asynchronous replication).
- **Cluster** with multiple nodes sharing storage or using distributed systems.

### Incident Response Process
1. Detect issue via monitoring or alerts.
2. Escalate if critical thresholds exceeded.
3. Triage by verifying logs and system resources.
4. Apply fix (failover, resource scaling, config change).
5. Document incident and lessons learned.

---

## 7. üîç SRE Practices for Database Performance

### Key Performance Metrics
- **Query Latency** (Response time)
- **Throughput** (Transactions per second)
- **Resource Utilization** (CPU, memory, disk, network)

### Common Bottlenecks & Solutions
- **Slow Queries**: Add indexes, optimize queries.
- **Lock Contention**: Use appropriate transaction isolation, break large transactions.
- **Hardware Resource Limits**: Scale vertically (bigger machines) or horizontally (sharding, replication).

### Performance Monitoring & Alerting
- **Dashboards** with real-time metrics, thresholds for automatic alerts.
- **Logs & Execution Plans** for root cause analysis of slow queries.

### Incident Response
- **Identify** hotspots or locked sessions.
- **Kill** blocking queries if necessary.
- **Optimize** schema, queries, or hardware for future prevention.

## 8. üî® Hands-On Exercises

Provide **3 exercises** for each tier:  

### üîç Beginner
1. **Create a new database user** with a secure password, then grant them read-only access to one table.
2. **Identify the difference** between system and object privileges by listing them in your database of choice.
3. **Audit** your own login attempts by checking the database‚Äôs security logs.

### üß© Intermediate
1. **Implement a role-based structure**: Create a role for a reporting team and grant `SELECT` privileges on multiple tables, then assign users to this role.
2. **Revise privileges**: Revoke direct privileges from a user, ensuring all required permissions come through the role.
3. **Set up basic monitoring**: Configure a built-in monitoring or logging tool to capture user activity and unsuccessful login attempts.

### üí° Advanced/SRE
1. **Implement a security policy**: Enforce strong password rules and enable auditing of all DDL commands.
2. **Script a failover test**: Write a scenario in which you intentionally bring down the primary database to verify the standby seamlessly takes over.
3. **Simulate high load**: Use a load testing tool to see if user authentication or permissions cause performance issues, then optimize accordingly.

## 9. üöß Troubleshooting Scenarios

### Scenario 1: ‚ÄúUser Suddenly Cannot Access Table‚Äù
- **Symptoms**: Login succeeds, but queries fail with ‚Äúpermission denied.‚Äù
- **Cause**: The user‚Äôs role lost `SELECT` privileges during a privileges revocation.
- **Diagnostic Approach**:
  1. **Check** database logs for GRANT/REVOKE statements.
  2. **Query** user‚Äôs effective privileges (`\du+` in Postgres or system views in Oracle/SQL Server).
- **Resolution**: Re-grant necessary privileges or reassign the user to the correct role.
- **Workflow** (Mermaid):
  

![Mermaid Diagram: flowchart](images/diagram-5-6b4246a8.png)



### Scenario 2: ‚ÄúSudden Spike in Slow Queries‚Äù
- **Symptoms**: Query times triple, CPU usage spikes.
- **Cause**: An unprivileged user was given `INSERT` privileges, leading to excessive data ingestion scripts running without optimization.
- **Diagnostic Approach**:
  - **Examine** running queries and user roles.
  - **Review** new or modified permissions and scheduled tasks.
- **Resolution**: Optimize the script or revoke the excessive privilege. Possibly create an ‚Äúimport user‚Äù role with more stringent resource limits.

### Scenario 3: ‚ÄúDatabase Connection Storm‚Äù
- **Symptoms**: Massive number of connections saturate DB resources.
- **Cause**: A newly created user runs a poorly written application that opens connections but never closes them.
- **Resolution**: Set connection pool limits, kill idle sessions, and educate on best coding practices.
