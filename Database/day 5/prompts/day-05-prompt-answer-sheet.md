## Database Focus Requirements

Ensure explanations focus on database-specific concepts and include:

1. **Aggregate function implementation details** where applicable (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX)
2. **GROUP BY and HAVING clause execution processes** in database engines
3. **Execution plan details** relevant to aggregation operations
4. **Performance optimization techniques** for different aggregation operations
5. **Differences between Oracle, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server** in aggregation implementation
6. **Database-specific aggregation hints and features** for performance tuning

## SRE Focus Requirements

For the SRE perspective section, include relevant insights about:

1. **Performance implications** of different aggregation functions and techniques
2. **Reliability considerations** related to complex aggregation operations
3. **Scaling challenges** with aggregations on large tables
4. **Monitoring approaches** for aggregation-related performance issues
5. **Resource management** for memory-intensive aggregation operations
6. **High availability strategies** for systems with heavy aggregation workloads

## Mermaid Diagram Considerations

For questions that reference or relate to Mermaid diagrams from the training:

1. **Diagram interpretation** - Explain how to interpret the visual elements correctly
2. **Aggregation visualization understanding** - Clarify how different aggregation types appear in diagrams
3. **Execution plan visualization** - Explain how to interpret execution plan diagrams for aggregation operations
4. **Common diagram mistakes** - Note typical errors in diagramming aggregation operations

## Mermaid Diagram Generation Guidelines

When creating explanations that involve Mermaid diagrams or when referring to diagrams, follow these formatting rules to ensure proper rendering:

1. **Always Enclose Node Labels in Quotes**
   * If a node label has **parentheses** `( )`, **colons** `:`, or **HTML tags** like `<br/>`, wrap it in quotes:
   ```
   A["HASH GROUP BY"]
   B["TABLE ACCESS FULL: SALES"]
   C["Line1<br/>Line2"]
   ```

2. **Use Self-Closing `<br/>` Tags**
   * For line breaks in node labels, use `<br/>` (with a slash) instead of `<br>`.
   * Keep them inside quotes: `["Line1<br/>Line2"]`.

3. **Subgraph Titles**
   * Always wrap subgraph titles in quotes:
   ```
   subgraph "Original Sales Table"
     S1["ID: 1<br/>Region: East<br/>Amount: 100"]
   end
   ```

4. **Use Separate Lines for Each Arrow or Connection**
   * Place each connection on its own line:
   ```
   A --> B
   B --> C
   ```
   * Avoid: `A --> B --> C`

5. **No Raw Text Immediately After `subgraph`**
   * Add nodes for text inside subgraphs instead of raw text:
   ```
   subgraph "My Subgraph"
     N["Some text"]
   end
   ```

6. **Avoid Ambiguous Characters in the Flow**
   * Keep characters like `#`, `?`, or additional punctuation inside quotes if needed.

7. **Simplify Complex Diagrams**
   * Break down complex relationships into simpler sections.
   * Test diagrams incrementally to ensure proper rendering.

Example of a correctly formatted Mermaid diagram for an aggregation answer explanation:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  subgraph "Execution Plan"
    A["SELECT Statement"] --> B["HASH GROUP BY"]
    B --> C["TABLE ACCESS FULL<br/>Sales"]
    B --> D["SORT GROUP BY<br/>Customer"]
  end
```

## Final Document Format Requirements

Generate a single Markdown document with the **full question text** followed by its **answer** and **explanation**, from Question 1 to Question 20. **Do not** create a separate section listing all 20 questions at the start. Instead, for each question:

1. Show the **question number** and **topic** (e.g., `[Aggregation Fundamentals]`),
2. Then **restate** just that one question's text,
3. Provide the **correct answer** label (e.g., A, B, C, D, or True/False, etc.),
4. **Explain** the reasoning in detail.

**Do not** produce a separate "Questions" section before the answer sheet. The deliverable is a single sequence of 20 entries, each containing the question's text and the associated answer/explanation.

Remember to observe, test, evaluate and take action when explaining answers to create comprehensive and educational responses. Apply the OTEA approach to each question's explanation:
- **Observe**: Identify the key concept being tested
- **Test**: Apply the correct reasoning to find the answer
- **Evaluate**: Consider why other options are incorrect or less optimal
- **Act**: Provide actionable insights that extend beyond the question

## Invocations Statement
Generate a comprehensive answer sheet for the Day 5 database training quiz questions on SQL Aggregate Functions and Data Summarization. For each question, provide the correct answer with detailed explanations, reasons why incorrect options are wrong, comparisons between different database systems where relevant, connections to Day 5 material, SRE perspectives on reliability and performance, and additional practical insights. 

Focus on explaining COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX functions, GROUP BY and HAVING clauses, performance optimization, window functions, and CRUD project schema considerations. Apply the "Observe, Test, Evaluate, Act" approach to each answer to create thorough and educational responses.

Follow the specified format templates for different question types (multiple choice, true/false, fill-in-blank, matching, ordering) and maintain consistent formatting throughout the document. Follow the Mermaid diagram formatting guidelines when creating or referencing diagrams in answer explanations to ensure proper rendering. The final document should present questions and answers in sequence without a separate questions section at the beginning.
