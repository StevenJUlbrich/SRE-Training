## Mermaid Diagram Generation Guidelines

When creating Mermaid diagrams for the training module, follow these formatting rules to ensure proper rendering:

1. **Always Enclose Node Labels in Quotes**
   * If a node label has **parentheses** `( )`, **colons** `:`, or **HTML tags** like `<br/>`, wrap it in quotes:
   ```
   A["COUNT(*)"]
   B["Table Access: CUSTOMERS"]
   C["Line1<br/>Line2"]
   ```

2. **Use Self-Closing `<br/>` Tags**
   * For line breaks in node labels, use `<br/>` (with a slash) instead of `<br>`.
   * Keep them inside quotes: `["Line1<br/>Line2"]`.

3. **Subgraph Titles**
   * Always wrap subgraph titles in quotes:
   ```
   subgraph "Original Table"
     C1["ID: 1<br/>Region: East<br/>Sales: 1000"]
   end
   ```

4. **Use Separate Lines for Each Arrow or Connection**
   * Place each connection on its own line:
   ```
   A --> B
   B --> C
   ```
   * Avoid: `A --> B --> C`

5. **No Raw Text Immediately After `subgraph`**
   * Add nodes for text inside subgraphs instead of raw text:
   ```
   subgraph "My Subgraph"
     N["Some text"]
   end
   ```

6. **Avoid Ambiguous Characters in the Flow**
   * Keep characters like `#`, `?`, or additional punctuation inside quotes if needed.

7. **Simplify Complex Diagrams**
   * Break down complex relationships into simpler sections.
   * Test diagrams incrementally to ensure proper rendering.

## Mermaid Diagram Specifications

For each type of diagram in the training module, follow these guidelines:

1. **Aggregation Operation Diagrams**
   * Use Mermaid's flowchart syntax to show tables before and after aggregation operations
   * Include sample data to demonstrate the effects of different aggregate functions
   * Use color coding or visual cues to indicate grouping operations
   * Example:
   ```
   ```mermaid
   flowchart LR
     subgraph "Original Table"
       T1["ID: 1<br/>Region: East<br/>Sales: 1000"]
       T2["ID: 2<br/>Region: East<br/>Sales: 1500"]
       T3["ID: 3<br/>Region: West<br/>Sales: 2000"]
       T4["ID: 4<br/>Region: West<br/>Sales: 2500"]
     end
     
     subgraph "After GROUP BY Region, SUM(Sales)"
       G1["Region: East<br/>Total Sales: 2500"]
       G2["Region: West<br/>Total Sales: 4500"]
     end
     
     T1 --> G1
     T2 --> G1
     T3 --> G2
     T4 --> G2
   ```
   ```

2. **Execution Plan Visualization**
   * Use Mermaid's flowchart syntax to represent database execution plans
   * Show operations and their sequence
   * Include cost estimates where relevant
   * Example:
   ```
   ```mermaid
   flowchart TD
     A["SELECT Statement"] --> B["HASH GROUP BY"]
     B --> C["TABLE ACCESS FULL<br/>Sales"]
   ```
   ```

3. **Decision Trees**
   * Use Mermaid's flowchart syntax with decision nodes
   * Include clear conditions and outcomes
   * Use consistent notation
   * Example:
   ```
   ```mermaid
   flowchart TD
     A{"Need to count<br/>rows?"} -->|Yes| B{"Include NULL<br/>values?"}
     B -->|Yes| C["Use COUNT(*)"]
     B -->|No| D["Use COUNT(column)"]
     A -->|No| E{"Need numeric<br/>calculation?"}
     E -->|Sum| F["Use SUM()"]
     E -->|Average| G["Use AVG()"]
   ```
   ```

4. **Performance Comparison Diagrams**
   * Use Mermaid's flowchart or graph syntax for comparative visualizations
   * Include metrics for comparison
   * Use clear visual indicators for better/worse approaches
   * Example:
   ```
   ```mermaid
   graph LR
     subgraph "With Index on GROUP BY column"
       A1["Query Cost: 24"]
       B1["Execution Time: 0.5s"]
       C1["Buffer Gets: 85"]
     end
     
     subgraph "Without Index"
       A2["Query Cost: 1240"]
       B2["Execution Time: 8.2s"]
       C2["Buffer Gets: 12500"]
     end
     
     A1 --- A2
     B1 --- B2
     C1 --- C2
   ```
   ```

Ensure all diagrams:
* Have clear titles
* Use consistent notation throughout
* Include legends where appropriate
* Are properly formatted with the ```mermaid syntax
* Enhance rather than duplicate the text content
