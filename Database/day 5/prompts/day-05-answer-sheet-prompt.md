## Special Considerations for Jin's Day 5 Material

When generating explanations, make sure to:

1. Reference Jin's personal anecdotes and realizations, such as:
   - "I once saw a table quadruple in size over a weekend with no stats update."
   - "We had a daily 'max event time' query that took 5 minutes. Adding an index turned it into a 0.05-second query."
   - "I once partitioned by region, ignoring that 'US' had 90% of data. That single partition hammered the instance."

2. Incorporate Jin's analogies:
   - "Metrics are your witnesses" for troubleshooting
   - "Full scan on big table" as a performance anti-pattern
   - Daily aggregation as a "running total" in specific partitions

3. Include Jin's SRE perspective on:
   - Dashboard performance and real-time monitoring
   - Proper aggregation strategies for high-traffic systems
   - Handling partition skew and memory constraints
   - Materialized views for critical dashboards

4. Reference specific database tools and views mentioned by Jin:
   - EXPLAIN PLAN for query analysis
   - Oracle's SORT GROUP BY vs. HASH GROUP BY
   - Wait event analysis for aggregation overhead
   - Index strategies for MIN/MAX optimization

For visual explanations, use Mermaid diagrams that resemble those in the original training material, especially:
- Flowcharts for aggregation data flow
- Partition diagrams for window functions
- Dashboard troubleshooting decision trees
- Performance comparison visualizations (before/after)

## Mermaid Diagram Guidelines for Answer Explanations

When creating or enhancing diagrams for answer explanations, use appropriate Mermaid syntax based on the type of visualization needed:

1. **Entity-Relationship Diagrams** for database structure explanations:
```mermaid
classDiagram
  class Table1 {
    +column1: datatype
    +column2: datatype
  }
  class Table2 {
    +column1: datatype
    +column2: datatype
  }
  Table1 "1" -- "n" Table2: relationship
```

2. **Flowcharts** for process explanations:
```mermaid
flowchart TD
  subgraph "Process Name"
    A["Step 1"]
    B["Step 2"]
    C["Step 3"]
    D["Step 4"]
  end
  A --> B
  B --> C
  C --> D
```

3. **Sequence Diagrams** for interaction explanations:
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Actor1
  participant Actor2
  participant System
  
  Actor1->>System: Action
  System-->>Actor1: Response
  Actor1->>Actor2: Communication
```

For all Mermaid diagrams, follow these formatting guidelines:
1. Always enclose node labels in quotes if they contain special characters or spaces
2. Use self-closing `<br/>` tags for line breaks in node labels
3. Wrap subgraph titles in quotes
4. Place each connection on a separate line
5. Add nodes for text inside subgraphs instead of raw text
6. Keep diagrams simple and focused on the concept being explained
