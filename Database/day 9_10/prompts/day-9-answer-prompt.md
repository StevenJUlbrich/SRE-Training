## Database-Specific Focus Requirements

Ensure explanations focus on database architecture concepts and include:

1. **Database paradigm characteristics** for SQL and NoSQL systems
2. **Transaction model differences** between ACID and BASE approaches
3. **Schema design considerations** for different data models
4. **Consistency model trade-offs** and their operational implications
5. **Cross-database integration patterns** for polyglot architectures

## SRE Focus Requirements

For the SRE perspective section, include relevant insights about:

1. **Availability trade-offs** of different database paradigms
2. **Monitoring considerations** for multiple database environments
3. **Incident response strategies** for polyglot architectures
4. **Performance implications** of different data models
5. **Data consistency verification** approaches

## Mermaid Diagram Guidelines for Answer Explanations

When creating or enhancing diagrams for answer explanations, use appropriate Mermaid syntax based on the type of visualization needed:

1. **Flowcharts** for database paradigm comparison:
```mermaid
flowchart TB
  subgraph "SQL"
    A["Structured Schema"]
    B["ACID Transactions"]
    C["Vertical Scaling"]
  end
  
  subgraph "NoSQL"
    D["Flexible Schema"]
    E["BASE Properties"]
    F["Horizontal Scaling"]
  end
```

2. **Sequence Diagrams** for transaction models:
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant ACID
  participant BASE
  
  ACID->>ACID: Begin Transaction
  ACID->>ACID: Atomicity Guarantees
  BASE->>BASE: Eventual Consistency
  BASE->>BASE: High Availability
```

3. **Architecture Diagrams** for polyglot integration:
```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph "Event-Driven Integration"
    A["Oracle"]
    B["Event Bus"]
    C["MongoDB"]
    D["Analytics"]
  end
  
  A -->|CDC| B
  C -->|Events| B
  B -->|Consumption| D
```

4. **Decision Trees** for database selection:
```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A["Database Choice"]
  B{"ACID Required?"}
  C["SQL Database"]
  D{"Scale Requirements?"}
  E["NoSQL Database"]
  
  A --> B
  B -->|Yes| C
  B -->|No| D
  D -->|Horizontal| E
```

For all Mermaid diagrams, follow these formatting guidelines:

1. **Always enclose node labels in quotes** if they contain special characters or spaces
2. **Use self-closing `<br/>` tags** for line breaks in node labels
3. **Wrap subgraph titles in quotes**
4. **Place each connection on a separate line**
5. **Add nodes for text inside subgraphs** instead of raw text
6. **Keep diagrams simple and focused** on the concept being explained

Enhance diagram-based question explanations by:
1. Adding visual cues to highlight key elements
2. Including before/after diagrams for comparative explanations
3. Showing potential issues and solutions visually
4. Illustrating architectural patterns and data flow

You may need to make reasonable inferences about the correct answers based on database fundamentals and Day 9 concepts if the quiz questions do not explicitly indicate the correct answer.
