Here's a prompt to generate Day 9 quiz questions based on the training material:

# üìù SRE Database Training Module - Day 9: Quiz Questions

## üßë‚Äçüè´ Role
You are an expert database instructor creating assessment questions for Day 9 of "The Follow-the-Sun Chronicles" training featuring Chlo√©, the Polyglot database architect based in Lyon, France. These questions will test knowledge from beginner to SRE-level concepts covered specifically in the Day 9 material, with the primary database focus being SQL vs. NoSQL architecture decisions and trade-offs.

## üìù Quiz Structure Requirements

Create quiz questions with the following distribution:
- (üîç) 7 Beginner-Level Questions
- (üß©) 7 Intermediate-Level Questions
- (üí°) 6 Advanced/SRE-Level Questions

Include the following question types with the specified distribution:
- 10 Multiple choice questions (traditional format with 4 options)
- 3 True/False questions
- 3 Fill-in-the-blank questions
- 2 Matching questions (match concepts to definitions)
- 2 Ordering questions (arrange steps in the correct sequence)

Each question must:
- Clearly indicate its difficulty level with the appropriate emoji
- Connect directly to content covered in the Day 9 material by Chlo√©
- Reference Chlo√©'s analogies, principles, rules, or commentaries where appropriate
- Include relevant context for scenario-based questions
- Include database-specific content as presented in the training

Several questions should incorporate Mermaid diagrams similar to those used in the Day 9 training for visual assessment.

   - Enhanced analogies (filing cabinet, dictionary, folder, etc.)
   - Chlo√©'s perspective on contextual validity of each approach

3. **ACID vs. BASE Properties**
   - Understanding transaction models in different database types
   - Real-world failure scenarios in both paradigms
   - Appropriate use cases for each consistency model
   - Chlo√©'s examples of applications suited to each model

4. **Schema Approaches**
   - Schema-on-Write vs. Schema-on-Read trade-offs
   - Migration complexities and data quality considerations
   - Chlo√©'s preference for stable systems vs. rapidly evolving data shapes
   - Managing schema evolution in different database paradigms

5. **Query Capabilities Comparison**
   - Syntax and capability differences across database types
   - Performance pitfalls in NoSQL queries
   - Bad NoSQL query patterns and their implications
   - Chlo√©'s warnings about treating NoSQL like relational databases

6. **Polyglot Architecture**
   - The "Bad Polyglot Story" cautionary tale
   - Decision frameworks and weighted scoring
   - Event-driven integration approaches
   - Chlo√©'s best practices for multi-database synchronization

## Mermaid Diagram Guidelines for Questions

When creating diagram-based questions, use appropriate Mermaid syntax based on the type of visualization needed:

1. **Flowcharts** for database paradigm comparison:
```mermaid
flowchart TB
   subgraph "Database Paradigms"
     SQL["Relational (SQL)"]
     NOSQL["Non-Relational (NoSQL)"]
   end
   SQL -->|ACID| A["Structured Tables,<br/>Rows, Columns"]
   NOSQL -->|BASE| B["Flexible schema,<br/>Key-Value/Doc/Column/Graph"]
```

2. **Sequence Diagrams** for transaction models:
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant ACID as ACID Transaction
  participant SQLDB as Oracle
  participant NoSQL as BASE System
  
  ACID->>SQLDB: BEGIN; Update account A; Update account B
  SQLDB-->>ACID: Either both updated or both rolled back
  ACID->>SQLDB: COMMIT;
```

3. **Process Flow Diagrams** for decision frameworks:
```mermaid
flowchart TB
    Start["Evaluate DB Requirements"]
    A["Need complex joins,<br/>ACID?"]
    B["Use SQL (Oracle)"]
    C["Need horizontal scale,<br/>flexible doc or KV?"]
    D["Use NoSQL (e.g., Cassandra/Mongo)"]
    
    Start --> A
    A -->|Yes| B
    A -->|No| C
    C -->|Yes| D
```

4. **Event Flow Diagrams** for polyglot integration:
```mermaid
flowchart LR
   subgraph "Event Bus (Kafka)"
     K["Topic: Data Events"]
   end
   R["Oracle<br/>(OLTP)"] --> K
   D["MongoDB<br/>(Docs)"] --> K
   K --> A["Analytics<br/>(Snowflake/Redshift)"]
```

Include diagrams that specifically reflect those used in the Day 9 training material, such as:
- Database paradigm comparison flowchart
- ACID vs. BASE sequence diagram
- Schema approach flowchart
- Decision framework flowchart
- Event-driven polyglot architecture diagram

## Special Considerations for Day 9

- Focus on Chlo√©'s specific terminology and phrases like "the bad polyglot story"
- Include questions related to Chlo√©'s rules of engagement and decision framework
- Reference Chlo√©'s analogies (library vs. bookstore, filing cabinet vs. dictionary)
- Incorporate Chlo√©'s unique perspective on evidence-based architecture decisions
- Include database-specific syntax examples from Oracle, MongoDB, Cassandra as presented in the training
- Address real-world polyglot scenarios and cautionary tales mentioned by Chlo√©

DO NOT include the correct answers or explanations in the questions themselves. These will be provided in a separate answer key document.
