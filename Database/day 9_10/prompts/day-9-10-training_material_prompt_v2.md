* Format Mermaid code blocks properly using the ```mermaid syntax
* Ensure all tables have consistent column widths and properly aligned headers

* Include clear transitions between sections
* Organize content with hierarchical headings for easy navigation

Remember to maintain the "brick by brick" learning approach, ensuring each concept builds logically on previous ones and that specific database details enhance rather than overwhelm the fundamental concepts.

## Mermaid Diagram Generation Guidelines

When creating Mermaid diagrams for the training module, follow these formatting rules to ensure proper rendering:

1. **Always Enclose Node Labels in Quotes**
   * If a node label has **parentheses** `( )`, **colons** `:`, or **HTML tags** like `<br/>`, wrap it in quotes:
   ```
   A["Relational Model"]
   B["Document Model: MongoDB"]
   C["Line1<br/>Line2"]
   ```

2. **Use Self-Closing `<br/>` Tags**
   * For line breaks in node labels, use `<br/>` (with a slash) instead of `<br>`.
   * Keep them inside quotes: `["Line1<br/>Line2"]`.

3. **Subgraph Titles**
   * Always wrap subgraph titles in quotes:
   ```
   subgraph "SQL Databases"
     S1["Oracle"]
     S2["PostgreSQL"]
   end
   ```

4. **Use Separate Lines for Each Arrow or Connection**
   * Place each connection on its own line:
   ```
   A --> B
   B --> C
   ```
   * Avoid: `A --> B --> C`

5. **No Raw Text Immediately After `subgraph`**
   * Add nodes for text inside subgraphs instead of raw text:
   ```
   subgraph "NoSQL Types"
     N["Different NoSQL database types"]
   end
   ```

6. **Avoid Ambiguous Characters in the Flow**
   * Keep characters like `#`, `?`, or additional punctuation inside quotes if needed.

7. **Simplify Complex Diagrams**
   * Break down complex relationships into simpler sections.
   * Test diagrams incrementally to ensure proper rendering.

## Mermaid Diagram Specifications

For Day 9 diagrams, focus on:
1. **Data Model Visualization**
2. **Consistency Model Comparison**
3. **Query Capability Visualization**
4. **Schema Approach Comparison**

For Day 10 diagrams, focus on:
1. **Architecture Pattern Visualization**
2. **Database Selection Decision Trees**
3. **Operational Monitoring Approaches**
4. **Multi-Database Data Flow**
5. **Migration Strategy Workflows**

Ensure all diagrams:
* Have clear titles
* Use consistent notation throughout
* Include legends where appropriate
* Are properly formatted with the ```mermaid syntax
* Enhance rather than duplicate the text content

## Python Code Examples Requirements

For Python code examples, ensure:
1. **Compatibility**: Code must be compatible with Python 3.11+ 
2. **Clarity**: Include comments explaining key aspects of the code
3. **Comparison**: Where possible, show equivalent operations across database types
4. **Dependencies**: Use standard libraries and modern database drivers that support Python 3.11+
   * For Oracle: Use `oracledb` (the newer replacement for deprecated cx_Oracle)
   * For other databases: Use current drivers (cassandra-driver, pymongo, boto3 for DynamoDB)
5. **Error Handling**: Include robust error handling practices with context managers where appropriate
6. **Configuration**: Separate configuration from code logic
7. **Realistic Usage**: Demonstrate practical use cases rather than contrived examples

Example Python code structure:
```python
# Oracle example using the modern oracledb library
import oracledb

# Connection setup using context manager for proper cleanup
with oracledb.connect(user="username", password="password", dsn="localhost:1521/ORCLPDB") as connection:
    # Execute query
    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM customers WHERE customer_id = :id", {"id": 123})
        
        # Process results
        for row in cursor:
            print(row)
    # No need for explicit cleanup with context managers

# Equivalent in Cassandra
from cassandra.cluster import Cluster
# ...similar structure with Cassandra-specific syntax
```
