---

### 10. [ACID vs BASE in Practice]
üß© Intermediate | Multiple Choice

A financial application requires **guaranteed atomic updates** to user balances. Which statement about selecting a database is **most accurate**?

## Advanced-Level (üí°) Questions

### 15. [Reliability Considerations]

A high-traffic e-commerce site uses a **document database** (MongoDB) with **replica sets**. It experiences intermittent stale reads when a secondary is behind the primary. Which solution most directly addresses this **stale read** concern?

A. Using a read preference of ‚Äúsecondary‚Äù to reduce load on the primary  
B. Configuring ‚ÄúreadConcern: majority‚Äù so that reads wait for changes to propagate to a majority of replicas
