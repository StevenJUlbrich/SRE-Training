## Day 9: SQL vs NoSQL Fundamentals

### üìå 1. Introduction to Database Paradigms

**Enthusiastic Welcome**  
Welcome to Day 9! Yesterday, you wrapped up performance tuning for relational databases. Today, let‚Äôs expand that foundation into a broader world‚Äîcomparing relational (SQL) databases to the many flavors of NoSQL.  

**Why This Matters**  
As applications grow, businesses often adopt multiple database types‚Äîsome data might be in a relational Oracle database, other data might live in a NoSQL system like Cassandra or DynamoDB. Support engineers and SREs need to understand the strengths, limitations, and operational characteristics of both paradigms.

**Real-World Support Scenario**  
Consider an e-commerce platform storing orders in Oracle (for financial consistency) and product catalog data in a NoSQL document store. When an end-to-end query spans both systems, debugging any performance or consistency issues requires broad database knowledge.

**Visual Concept Map**  
Below is a high-level Mermaid diagram illustrating where SQL and NoSQL fit in the database ecosystem:

    B --> E["Column-Family Stores"]
    B --> F["Graph Databases"]
    
    A --- G["ACID Transactions"]
    B --- H["BASE/Eventually Consistent"]
```

**Historical Context**  
Relational databases date back to the 1970s, dominating due to their robust SQL standards and strong consistency. With massive web-scale applications came NoSQL, which emphasized horizontal scaling and flexible schemas.

### üíª 4. Day 9 Concept Breakdown

#### 4.1 Database Paradigms Overview

- **Beginner Analogy**  
  Relational: a neat spreadsheet with rows/columns.  
  NoSQL: a set of variously shaped containers‚Äîsome are like dictionaries (key-value), others like documents.  

- **Mermaid Diagram**  
  ```mermaid
  flowchart TB
    subgraph "Database Paradigms"
      A["Relational (SQL)"] --> B["NoSQL"]
      B --> C["Key-Value"]
      B --> D["Document"]
      B --> E["Column-Family"]
      B --> F["Graph"]
    end
  ```

- **Technical Explanation**  
  **Relational** databases enforce schemas at write time (schema-on-write) and typically prioritize ACID properties. **NoSQL** solutions focus on scalability, often using BASE (eventual consistency).  

- **Support/SRE Application**  
  Different paradigms require different troubleshooting approaches (e.g., indexing in SQL vs. partition key design in NoSQL).  

- **System Impact**  
  Relational systems can be CPU/memory heavy; NoSQL can handle horizontally scalable, massive workloads with simpler queries.  

- **Common Misconception**  
  ‚ÄúNoSQL can replace all relational systems.‚Äù Each has its place depending on data type, consistency needs, and query patterns.  

- **Implementation Comparison**  
  - **Oracle** (relational) vs. **MongoDB** (document) vs. **Cassandra** (column-family).  

#### 4.2 Data Models Comparison

- **Beginner Analogy**  
  - **Relational**: A fully labeled library with strict shelving.  
  - **Key-Value**: A dictionary: key to value.  
  - **Document**: A pile of different documents, each with its own structure.  
  - **Column-Family**: A giant spreadsheet with flexible columns per row.  
  - **Graph**: A map of connected cities (nodes) and roads (edges).  

- **Mermaid Diagram**  
  ```mermaid
  flowchart LR
    A["Relational Table"] --> B["Key-Value"]
    A --> C["Document JSON"]
    A --> D["Column-Family<br/>Wide Rows"]
    A --> E["Graph<br/>Nodes+Edges"]
  ```

- **Technical Explanation**  
  Each model suits different needs. Graph DBs handle relationships well, while key-value stores excel at simple lookups.  

- **Support/SRE Application**  
  Understanding the data model aids in diagnosing performance issues and planning expansions.  

- **System Impact**  
  If your system is heavy on relationships (e.g., social networks), a graph DB might excel. If you need flexible data formats, a document store is ideal.  

- **Common Misconception**  
  ‚ÄúAll NoSQL are the same.‚Äù They vary significantly (key-value vs. graph is a big difference).  

- **Implementation Comparison**  
  | Model Type        | Example DB  | Ideal Use Case                          |
  |-------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------|
  | Relational        | Oracle      | Transactions, complex joins            |
  | Key-Value         | DynamoDB    | Caching, session data, simple lookups   |
  | Document          | MongoDB     | Flexible schemas, nested data          |
  | Column-Family     | Cassandra   | Time-series, high write throughput      |
  | Graph             | Neo4j       | Relationship-heavy data, recommendations|

#### 4.3 ACID vs. BASE Properties

- **Beginner Analogy**  
  - **ACID**: Like a perfectly maintained ledger that never has an inconsistent entry.  
  - **BASE**: Like a set of news feeds that eventually show the latest info, but not always immediately.  

- **Mermaid Diagram**  
  ```mermaid
  flowchart TB
    A["ACID"] --> B["Atomicity<br/>Consistency<br/>Isolation<br/>Durability"]
    C["BASE"] --> D["Basically Available<br/>Soft State<br/>Eventual Consistency"]
  ```

- **Technical Explanation**  
  ACID enforces strict transactional consistency. BASE systems often forgo immediate consistency for availability and partition tolerance.  

- **Support/SRE Application**  
  Choose ACID when data correctness is paramount (e.g., financials). BASE can be used in distributed systems that demand high availability (e.g., social feeds).  

- **System Impact**  
  ACID can mean higher overhead but ensures strong consistency. BASE prioritizes availability, allowing stale reads.  

- **Common Misconception**  
  ‚ÄúBASE = no consistency.‚Äù In reality, it is eventual consistency, which can be tuned.  

- **Implementation Comparison**  
  - **Oracle**: ACID  
  - **DynamoDB**: BASE with optional strong reads  

#### 4.4 Relational Database Recap (Oracle)

- **Beginner Analogy**  
  Oracle is like a well-managed office building with multiple floors (schemas), a strong security guard (DBA), and well-defined entry points (tables).  

- **Mermaid Diagram**  
  ```mermaid
  flowchart LR
      A["Tables"] --> B["Columns"]
      A --> C["Rows"]
      B --> D["Constraints"]
  ```

- **Technical Explanation**  
  Oracle organizes data into tables, adheres to ACID, and often runs on specialized hardware or in the cloud.  

- **Support/SRE Application**  
  Monitoring performance with Oracle Enterprise Manager, ensuring backups with RMAN, and tuning queries.  

- **System Impact**  
  High consistency, well-defined schemas, typically vertical scaling (but Oracle RAC supports clustering).  

- **Common Misconception**  
  ‚ÄúOracle doesn‚Äôt scale horizontally.‚Äù RAC can provide scale-out capabilities.  

#### 4.5 Key-Value Stores (DynamoDB, Redis)

- **Beginner Analogy**  
  A phone directory: Each name (key) has one phone number (value).  

- **Mermaid Diagram**  
  ```mermaid
  flowchart TB
    subgraph "Key-Value Store"
      K["Key"] --> V["Value"]
    end
  ```

- **Technical Explanation**  
  This model is simple: read and write via a key. Some key-value stores (like DynamoDB) add features like secondary indexes.  

- **Support/SRE Application**  
  - **Redis**: In-memory cache for session management.  
  - **DynamoDB**: Highly scalable, serverless usage-based pricing.  

- **System Impact**  
  Very fast lookups, minimal overhead. Horizontal scaling is typically straightforward.  

- **Common Misconception**  
  ‚ÄúKey-value stores have no indexing.‚Äù Some offer limited indexes.  

#### 4.6 Document Databases (MongoDB, Couchbase)

- **Beginner Analogy**  
  Like a set of filing cabinets with documents that can each have different formats.  

- **Mermaid Diagram**  
  ```mermaid
  flowchart LR
    A["Collection"] --> B["Document"]
    B --> C["JSON/BSON Fields"]
  ```

- **Technical Explanation**  
  Stores data as structured documents (often JSON or BSON). Schemas are flexible, typically schema-on-read.  

- **Support/SRE Application**  
  Easy to add new fields without schema migrations; watch for large, unbounded documents that can affect performance.  

- **System Impact**  
  Sharding is common for horizontal scale, queries can be complex if data is nested.  

- **Common Misconception**  
  ‚ÄúDocument DBs have no schema.‚Äù They do‚Äîjust enforced differently, often at read time.  

#### 4.7 Column-Family Stores (Cassandra, HBase)

- **Beginner Analogy**  
  Like a massive spreadsheet with potentially thousands of columns, each row can have its own set of columns.  

- **Mermaid Diagram**  
  ```mermaid
  flowchart TB
    A["Table"] --> B["Row Key"]
    B --> C["Columns"]
    C --> D["Wide Rows"]
  ```

- **Technical Explanation**  
  Data is grouped by column families, designed for high write throughput, multi-region replication.  

- **Support/SRE Application**  
  Monitoring cluster health with `nodetool` (Cassandra), tuning consistency levels, ensuring data is properly partitioned.  

- **System Impact**  
  Very efficient for time-series or event data; poor design of partition keys can lead to hotspots.  

- **Common Misconception**  
  ‚ÄúColumn-family means infinite columns.‚Äù In practice, there are practical limits on row size.  

#### 4.8 Graph Databases (Neo4j)

- **Beginner Analogy**  
  Like a social network of friends, each node is a person, each relationship is a connection.  

- **Mermaid Diagram**  
  ```mermaid
  flowchart LR
    A["Node"] --> B["Relationship"]
    B --> C["Node"]
  ```

- **Technical Explanation**  
  Data is stored as nodes and edges, ideal for queries involving paths or relationships.  

- **Support/SRE Application**  
  Ideal for fraud detection, recommendation engines (where relationships matter).  

- **System Impact**  
  Graph traversals can be much faster than equivalent joins in a relational DB.  

- **Common Misconception**  
  ‚ÄúGraph databases are only for social networks.‚Äù They‚Äôre also valuable for logistics, permission trees, etc.

#### 4.9 Schema Approaches (schema-on-write vs. schema-on-read)

- **Beginner Analogy**  
  - **Schema-on-write**: Fill out a government form with all required fields before submission.  
  - **Schema-on-read**: Throw your receipts in a box and sort them when you need them.  

- **Mermaid Diagram**  
  ```mermaid
  flowchart TB
    A["Schema-on-Write<br/>(Relational)"]
    B["Schema-on-Read<br/>(NoSQL)"]
    A --> C["Strict Upfront<br/>Definition"]
    B --> D["Flexible Structure<br/>at Query Time"]
  ```

- **Technical Explanation**  
  In relational systems, data must match a pre-defined structure. In many NoSQL systems, you can insert data with minimal schema constraints, defining structure when you read/interpret the data.  

- **Support/SRE Application**  
  Changing schemas in a relational DB can require downtime; NoSQL can be more flexible.  

- **System Impact**  
  Potential for inconsistent data in NoSQL if not carefully managed.  

- **Common Misconception**  
  ‚ÄúNoSQL doesn‚Äôt have schemas.‚Äù Many organizations maintain ‚Äòlogical‚Äô schemas anyway for data consistency.  

#### 4.10 Query Capabilities Comparison (SQL, CQL, etc.)

- **Beginner Analogy**  
  - **SQL**: A universal language with defined syntax for complex joins and aggregations.  
  - **NoSQL Queries**: Often specialized (CQL in Cassandra, JSON-based queries in MongoDB).  

- **Mermaid Diagram**  
  ```mermaid
  flowchart LR
    A["SQL Queries"] --> B["Complex Joins<br/>Aggregations"]
    C["NoSQL Queries"] --> D["Simpler or Model-specific<br/>Limited Joins"]
  ```

- **Technical Explanation**  
  SQL is standardized but not always easy to scale horizontally. NoSQL queries vary widely, some are partial subsets of SQL (like Cassandra‚Äôs CQL).  

- **Support/SRE Application**  
  Tools differ for each system. Understanding the query language helps in troubleshooting slow queries or timeouts.  

- **System Impact**  
  Complex joins can be expensive; NoSQL often denormalizes data instead of joining.  

- **Common Misconception**  
  ‚ÄúNoSQL queries are always easier.‚Äù They can become complicated for advanced analytics.

### üîÑ 5. Data Modeling Across Paradigms

**Transforming a Relational Model to NoSQL**  
- For a ‚ÄúCustomers‚Äù table in Oracle, you could have:  
  - **Key-Value**: `customer_id -> JSON blob`  
  - **Document**: a collection ‚Äúcustomers‚Äù with JSON objects  
  - **Column-Family**: row key = `customer_id`, columns for attributes  
  - **Graph**: a node labeled ‚ÄúCustomer,‚Äù edges to related nodes (Orders, Addresses)

**Mermaid Diagram**  
```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph "Relational Model"
      R["Customers Table"]
    end

    subgraph "NoSQL Models"
      KV["Key-Value: customer_id->data"]
      DOC["Document: JSON object"]
      CF["Column-Family: wide rows"]
      G["Graph: Node=Customer"]
    end

    R --> KV
    R --> DOC
    R --> CF
    R --> G
```

**Trade-offs**  
- Denormalization often needed for NoSQL to optimize reads.  
- Relational may require joining multiple tables, but that‚Äôs natively supported with SQL.

---

### üîç 6. Query Approaches Comparison

**SQL vs. NoSQL**  
- **SQL**:  
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM customers WHERE customer_id = 123;
  ```  
- **Cassandra (CQL)**:  
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM customers WHERE customer_id = 123;
  ```  
  (Looks similar but lacks joins.)  
- **MongoDB (JSON Query)**:  
  ```python
  db.customers.find({"customer_id": 123})
  ```  
- **DynamoDB (Key Lookup)**:  
  ```python
  response = table.get_item(Key={"customer_id": 123})
  ```

**Python Code Examples** (Python 3.11+)

```python
# Oracle example using oracledb
import oracledb

dsn_str = "localhost:1521/ORCLPDB"
with oracledb.connect(user="username", password="password", dsn=dsn_str) as connection:
    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM customers WHERE customer_id = :id", {"id": 123})
        for row in cursor:
            print(row)

# MongoDB example
from pymongo import MongoClient

client = MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
db = client["mydb"]
customers = db["customers"]
customer = customers.find_one({"customer_id": 123})
print(customer)
```

### üíª 4. Day 10 Concept Breakdown

#### 4.1 Detailed Database Comparison: Oracle vs. Cassandra

- **Beginner Analogy**  
  Oracle = a highly organized, centralized library. Cassandra = a network of smaller libraries with replicated books.

- **Mermaid Diagram**  
  ```mermaid
  flowchart LR
      O["Oracle"] --> C["Cassandra"]
      O --> A["ACID Transactions"]
      C --> B["BASE / Tunable Consistency"]
  ```

- **Technical Explanation**  
  Oracle excels at complex SQL queries, strong ACID transactions. Cassandra offers peer-to-peer architecture, linear scalability, and wide-column data modeling.

- **Support/SRE Application**  
  - Oracle: Manage resources, optimize queries, maintain indexes.  
  - Cassandra: Monitor ring state with `nodetool`, ensure proper replication factor, handle token ranges.

- **System Impact**  
  - Oracle can require more expensive hardware or rely on RAC for scale.  
  - Cassandra scales horizontally across commodity servers.

- **Common Misconception**  
  ‚ÄúCassandra can replace Oracle in all cases.‚Äù Some workloads need Oracle‚Äôs advanced SQL or transaction features.

#### 4.2 Detailed Database Comparison: Oracle vs. DynamoDB

- **Beginner Analogy**  
  Oracle = You buy and manage your own warehouse. DynamoDB = You rent space in an automated warehouse that charges you by usage.

- **Mermaid Diagram**  
  ```mermaid
  flowchart TB
      A["Oracle"] --> B["DynamoDB"]
  ```

- **Technical Explanation**  
  DynamoDB is fully managed, pay-per-request, with optional global tables. Oracle is self-managed or cloud-hosted, often requiring specialized tuning or hardware.

- **Support/SRE Application**  
  - Oracle: Admin tasks (patching, backup, resource allocation).  
  - DynamoDB: Manage read/write capacity units, monitor CloudWatch metrics.

- **System Impact**  
  - Oracle: Potentially higher fixed costs, but deep feature set.  
  - DynamoDB: No server management, but limited query patterns (partition/sort key).

- **Common Misconception**  
  ‚ÄúManaged means no maintenance.‚Äù You still must design table structures, indexes, and read/write capacity carefully.

#### 4.3 Kafka and Streaming Platforms

- **Beginner Analogy**  
  A conveyor belt system that sends messages (events) to different ‚Äústations‚Äù (consumer groups).

- **Mermaid Diagram**  
  ```mermaid
  flowchart LR
      P["Producers"] --> K["Kafka Topic"]
      K --> C1["Consumer Group 1"]
      K --> C2["Consumer Group 2"]
  ```

- **Technical Explanation**  
  Kafka is used for real-time event streaming, not as a primary database. However, it can integrate with both SQL and NoSQL for event sourcing.

- **Support/SRE Application**  
  Monitor brokers, handle partition assignment, ensure consumer lag is minimal.  

- **System Impact**  
  Adds complexity but decouples services.

- **Common Misconception**  
  ‚ÄúKafka can replace a database.‚Äù It‚Äôs complementary, focused on streaming, not persistent querying in the traditional sense.

#### 4.4 Performance Characteristics

- **Beginner Analogy**  
  Some databases are ‚Äúsprinters‚Äù (quick transactions), others are ‚Äúmarathoners‚Äù (handle continuous heavy loads with horizontal scale).

- **System Impact**  
  - Latency vs. throughput trade-offs.  
  - Relational might have more overhead for complex queries, NoSQL might handle more requests with simpler queries.

- **Common Misconception**  
  ‚ÄúHigh throughput is always best.‚Äù Low latency can be critical for user experience.

#### 4.5 Scaling Approaches (Vertical vs. Horizontal)

- **Beginner Analogy**  
  - **Vertical**: Build a taller building.  
  - **Horizontal**: Construct more buildings of moderate height.

- **Mermaid Diagram**  
  ```mermaid
  flowchart LR
      V["Vertical Scaling"] --> S["Add CPU/RAM"]
      H["Horizontal Scaling"] --> N["Add More Nodes"]
  ```

- **Technical Explanation**  
  Relational DBs historically scale vertically (bigger servers). NoSQL typically scales horizontally with sharding/partitioning.

- **Support/SRE Application**  
  Plan expansions, monitor CPU usage or cluster node capacity.

- **System Impact**  
  Horizontal scaling often suits distributed workloads.

- **Common Misconception**  
  ‚ÄúVertical is cheaper.‚Äù At large scales, horizontal can be more cost-effective.

#### 4.6 High Availability Configurations

- **Beginner Analogy**  
  Having backup drivers for a bus route. When one driver is sick, another steps in.

- **Mermaid Diagram**  
  ```mermaid
  flowchart LR
      A["Primary Database"] --> B["Standby/Replicas"]
      B --> A
  ```

- **Technical Explanation**  
  - Oracle: Data Guard, RAC for HA.  
  - Cassandra: Peer-to-peer replication with configurable consistency.  
  - DynamoDB: Multi-region tables with eventual consistency.

- **Support/SRE Application**  
  Configure failover, test failover scenarios.

- **System Impact**  
  Minimizes downtime but adds replication overhead.

- **Common Misconception**  
  ‚ÄúHA = Zero downtime.‚Äù Failover can still introduce short disruptions.

#### 4.7 Backup and Recovery Strategies

- **Beginner Analogy**  
  Making copies of important documents and storing them in different safes.

- **Technical Explanation**  
  - Oracle: RMAN, incremental backups, flashback features.  
  - Cassandra: Snapshots + incremental backups.  
  - DynamoDB: Point-in-time recovery.

- **Support/SRE Application**  
  Automate backups, ensure they‚Äôre tested, keep them offsite.

- **System Impact**  
  Backup frequency vs. performance overhead.  

- **Common Misconception**  
  ‚ÄúCloud services handle backups automatically.‚Äù They may provide tools, but you must configure and verify them.

#### 4.8 Monitoring and Observability

- **Beginner Analogy**  
  Using multiple sensors on a factory floor for real-time status.

- **Mermaid Diagram**  
  ```mermaid
  flowchart LR
      M["Metrics Collection"] --> D["Dashboards"]
      D --> A["Alerts"]
  ```

- **Technical Explanation**  
  Collect system, DB metrics (CPU, memory, query performance). Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, Oracle Enterprise Manager, CloudWatch.

- **Support/SRE Application**  
  Set alert thresholds, watch for anomalies, create incident response playbooks.

- **System Impact**  
  Over-monitoring can cause overhead, but insufficient monitoring leads to blind spots.

- **Common Misconception**  
  ‚ÄúMonitoring is set-and-forget.‚Äù It requires ongoing tuning.

#### 4.9 Database Selection Criteria Framework

- **Beginner Analogy**  
  Like choosing a vehicle: a van for more passengers, a motorcycle for speed, etc.

- **Mermaid Decision Tree**  
  ```mermaid
  flowchart TB
      A["Start"] --> B{"Data Complexity?"}
      B -->|High| C["Relational SQL"]
      B -->|Low| D["Key-Value / Document"]
      D --> E{"Scale Requirements?"}
      E -->|Massive| F["Column-Family / DynamoDB"]
      E -->|Modest| G["Simple RDB or Key-Value"]
  ```

- **System Impact**  
  Evaluate data relationships, scaling needs, transaction strictness.

#### 4.10 Polyglot Persistence and Hybrid Architectures

- **Beginner Analogy**  
  Using different tools in a workshop‚Äîeach specialized for a particular task.

- **Mermaid Diagram**  
  ```mermaid
  flowchart LR
      Subgraph1["Application Layer"] --> OracleDB["Oracle"]
      Subgraph1 --> CassDB["Cassandra"]
      Subgraph1 --> Kafka["Kafka"]
  ```

- **Technical Explanation**  
  Running multiple databases for different workloads (transactions, analytics, caching) can optimize performance.

- **Support/SRE Application**  
  Know how data flows between systems, unify monitoring.  

- **System Impact**  
  Higher complexity, but can yield better performance for specialized workloads.

- **Common Misconception**  
  ‚ÄúMore databases = always better.‚Äù Complexity can lead to higher ops overhead.

### üõ†Ô∏è 5. Operational Management Comparison

**Monitoring Approaches**  
- Oracle: Oracle Enterprise Manager, AWR reports.  
- Cassandra: `nodetool`, Prometheus exporters.  
- DynamoDB: AWS CloudWatch metrics.

**Mermaid Dashboard Example**  
```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["Oracle Metrics"] --> B["Unified Dashboard"]
    C["Cassandra Metrics"] --> B
    D["DynamoDB Metrics"] --> B
```

**Python Script Example** (monitoring integration snippet)

```python
import requests

def collect_oracle_metrics():
    # Placeholder for actual Oracle monitoring approach
    return {"oracle_sessions": 42, "oracle_cpu_percent": 65}

def collect_cassandra_metrics():
    # Simulate calls to a Prometheus endpoint or nodetool parse
    return {"cassandra_nodes_up": 5, "cassandra_latency_ms": 10}

def main():
    oracle_data = collect_oracle_metrics()
    cass_data = collect_cassandra_metrics()
    
    # Combine and send to centralized system
    combined_metrics = {**oracle_data, **cass_data}
    requests.post("http://monitoring-service.local/metrics", json=combined_metrics)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### üîç 6. Database Selection and Migration

**Methodology**  
1. Identify requirements (throughput, latency, consistency).  
2. Evaluate existing data models.  
3. Choose database type that best fits.  

**Mermaid Decision Tree**  
```mermaid
flowchart TB
    A["Gather Requirements"] --> B{"Transaction Heavy?"}
    B -->|Yes| C["Relational"]
    B -->|No| D["NoSQL"]
    D --> E{"Flexible Schema?"}
    E -->|Yes| F["Document DB"]
    E -->|No| G["Column-Family or Key-Value"]
```

**Migration Approaches**  
- **Big Bang:** All data at once.  
- **Trickle Migration:** Parallel systems, gradually shift traffic.  

**Pitfalls**  
- Data format mismatches, downtime planning, partial migrations causing inconsistency.

### üß∞ 7. Multi-Database Architecture Patterns

**Common Hybrid Patterns**  
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**  
- **Event Sourcing with Kafka**  
- **Dedicated Analytics DB** (e.g., Spark + Cassandra)

**Mermaid Workflow**  
```mermaid
flowchart LR
    App["User App"] --> OracleDB["Oracle"]
    OracleDB --> Kafka["Kafka Stream"]
    Kafka --> Cassandra["Cassandra for Analytics"]

### üöß 9. Day 10 Troubleshooting Scenarios

1. **Scenario: Cross-Database Latency**  
   - **Symptoms**: Slow user-facing endpoints that fetch data from both Oracle and Cassandra.  
   - **Causes**: Network lag, unoptimized queries, or inconsistent indexing strategies.  
   - **Diagnostic Approach**: Trace calls, measure latency in each DB.  
   - **Resolution**: Tune Oracle queries (add indexes), ensure Cassandra partition keys are efficient.

   ```mermaid
   flowchart LR
       User["User Request"] --> App["Application"]
       App --> Oracle["Oracle Queries"]
       App --> Cass["Cassandra Queries"]
       Cass --> App
       Oracle --> App
       App --> User
   ```

2. **Scenario: Partial DynamoDB Outage**  
   - **Symptoms**: High error rates in one AWS region.  
   - **Causes**: Region-specific issues or misconfigured capacity units.  
   - **Diagnostic Approach**: Check AWS Health Dashboard, CloudWatch metrics.  
   - **Resolution**: Add capacity, redirect writes to another region, or auto-scale.

3. **Scenario: Oracle Backup Failure**  
   - **Symptoms**: Scheduled backups fail, logs show insufficient disk space.  
   - **Causes**: RMAN default location is full, or archive logs not purged.  
   - **Diagnostic Approach**: Examine RMAN logs, check disk usage, check scheduling.  
   - **Resolution**: Clean up old backups, expand storage, revise backup retention.

### üî• 11. Comprehensive SRE-Specific Scenario (Spanning Days 9 & 10)

**Scenario Overview**  
An e-commerce app uses:
- **Oracle**: Financial transactions  
- **Cassandra**: Product catalog and user sessions  
- **Kafka**: Ingest real-time events (user clicks, page views)  
- **Redis**: Caching session data

**Incident**  
- Users see stale product prices and sporadic checkout failures.  
- Monitoring shows Cassandra read timeouts and Oracle CPU spikes.

**Diagnostic Approach**  
1. Use distributed tracing to identify latency in the microservices calling both Oracle and Cassandra.  
2. Check Oracle AWR reports to see if certain queries are overloading CPU.  
3. Run `nodetool status` on Cassandra to see if any node is down or if the cluster is imbalanced.

**Resolution Steps**  
1. Add an index or rewrite an inefficient Oracle query.  
2. Resolve Cassandra partition hotspots by adjusting partition keys or adding nodes.  
3. Confirm that the Kafka consumer streaming price updates is functioning properly (no lag).

**Key SRE Principles**  
- **Observability**: Having dashboards that show both Oracle query times and Cassandra latencies.  
- **Resilience**: Ensuring multi-node Cassandra ring and Oracle HA.  
- **Automation**: Using scripts to automate failover and scaling.  
- **Postmortems**: Documenting root cause, implementing permanent fixes (e.g., new partitioning strategy).
