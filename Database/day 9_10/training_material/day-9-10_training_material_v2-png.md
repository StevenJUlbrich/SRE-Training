### üìö **Day 9 Core Concepts**

Below are the **10 key concepts** for Day 9. Each concept includes a beginner-friendly analogy, a visual, and more advanced insights for SREs.

---

#### 1. **Database Paradigms Overview**

- **Beginner Analogy**: Think of **SQL databases** like a carefully organized library with a strict cataloging system. **NoSQL** is more like an eclectic bookstore with different sections (some sorted by title, some by genre, some by author) but with more relaxed rules.
  
- **Visual Representation**  
  

![Mermaid Diagram: flowchart](images/diagram-2-3f364f93.png)



- **Technical Explanation**  
  - **SQL** (Relational): Defined schema, relational model, joins, strong consistency via ACID.  
  - **NoSQL**: Often schemaless or flexible schema, designed for **horizontal scaling**, can prioritize availability over strict consistency (BASE properties).

- **Support/SRE Application**  
  - Real-world: You may have to support queries that go from a structured Oracle table to a key-value store. Understanding these fundamentals helps you **diagnose performance issues and data inconsistency** problems.

- **System Impact**  
  - **SQL**: Typically scales **vertically** (larger machines) or with advanced partitioning/sharding.  
  - **NoSQL**: Designed to scale **horizontally** across many commodity nodes.

- **Common Misconception**  
  - ‚ÄúNoSQL can‚Äôt handle transactions.‚Äù In reality, many NoSQL databases offer **configurable consistency**, or partial ACID transactions (e.g., MongoDB‚Äôs multi-document transactions).

- **Implementation Comparison**  
  | Aspect            | SQL (Oracle)                             | NoSQL (Cassandra, DynamoDB)                                  |
  |-------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
  | Schema            | Strict, Predefined                        | Flexible/Schema-on-read                                     |
  | Consistency       | Strong (ACID)                             | Eventual, Tunable (BASE)                                    |
  | Scaling           | Mainly Vertical + Partitioning            | Horizontal by default                                       |
  | Query Language    | SQL                                       | CQL (Cassandra), Proprietary APIs (DynamoDB), etc.          |
  | Ideal Use Case    | Complex transactions, analytics           | High throughput, massive scale, flexible data structures    |

---

#### 2. **Data Models Comparison**  
- **Relational**: Tables with rows and columns.  
- **Key-Value**: Simple, (key ‚Üí value) lookups.  
- **Document**: JSON/BSON documents with flexible schema.  
- **Column-Family**: Wide-column structures, each row can have varying columns.  
- **Graph**: Focuses on relationships as first-class entities.



![Mermaid Diagram: flowchart](images/diagram-3-7b4c1982.png)



- **Beginner Analogy**:  
  - **Relational**: Filing cabinets with labeled folders.  
  - **Key-Value**: A dictionary or phone book with quick lookups.  
  - **Document**: A folder of self-contained articles (each article can have unique structure).  
  - **Column-Family**: A matrix, but each row can have different columns.  
  - **Graph**: A network of interconnected dots.

---

#### 3. **ACID vs BASE Properties**

- **ACID** (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability): Ensures strict transaction guarantees.   
- **BASE** (Basically Available, Soft-state, Eventually consistent): Prioritizes availability and partition tolerance over strict consistency.

**Implications**:
- **ACID**: Bank transfers in Oracle.  
- **BASE**: Social media feed updates in Cassandra or DynamoDB.

---

#### 4. **Relational Database Recap** (Focus on Oracle)

- **Normalization**: Minimizing data redundancy.  
- **Relationships**: Primary key/foreign key constraints.  
- **Schema-on-write**: You must define the schema before inserting data.  
- **Oracle specifics**: PL/SQL, advanced partitioning, strong transaction consistency.

---

#### 5. **Key-Value Stores** (Example: DynamoDB, Redis)

- **Structure**: Data stored as a simple pair (key, value).  
- **Strengths**: Very fast lookups, easy to scale horizontally.  
- **Limitations**: Less suited for complex queries requiring joins.  

---

#### 6. **Document Databases** (Example: MongoDB, Couchbase)

- **Flexible JSON/BSON** structure.  
- **Strengths**: Rapid development, easy to store complex nested data.  
- **Limitations**: Data duplication (denormalization) often needed.  

---

#### 7. **Column-Family Stores** (Example: Cassandra, HBase)

- **Wide-column approach**: Each row can have thousands of columns grouped into ‚Äúfamilies.‚Äù  
- **Strengths**: Excellent write scalability, fault tolerance, distributed by design.  
- **Limitations**: Can be complex to design for certain query patterns.  

---

#### 8. **Graph Databases** (Example: Neo4j)

- **Focus**: Relationships are first-class citizens (edges).  
- **Strengths**: Superb for **social networks, recommendation systems**.  
- **Limitations**: Niche use cases, specialized query languages (Cypher).  

---

#### 9. **Schema Approaches** (Schema-on-Write vs. Schema-on-Read)

| Approach                  | Description                                              | Examples          |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Schema-on-Write**       | Data must conform to a predefined schema before storage | Oracle, MySQL     |
| **Schema-on-Read**        | Data stored flexibly, structure imposed during queries  | MongoDB, DynamoDB |

- **Evolution Strategies**:  
  - Use versioned schema for NoSQL to manage incremental changes.  
  - For relational, changes require **ALTER TABLE** or migrations.

---

#### 10. **Query Capabilities Comparison**

| Database Type | Query Language/Interface                      |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Oracle (SQL)  | SQL, PL/SQL for stored procedures             |
| Cassandra     | CQL (similar to SQL, but with keyspace focus) |
| DynamoDB      | Proprietary API + PartiQL (a SQL-like syntax) |
| MongoDB       | Mongo Shell Queries or MongoDB Query API      |
| Neo4j         | Cypher Query Language                         |

- **Performance**:  
  - SQL joins can become expensive as datasets grow, but are very powerful.  
  - NoSQL queries often rely on denormalized data for speed.

---

### üîÑ **Data Modeling Across Paradigms**

- **Transforming a Relational Model into NoSQL**:  
  1. Identify the **entity-relationship** in Oracle.  
  2. Determine which access patterns are critical for performance.  
  3. **Denormalize** data for NoSQL solutions to reduce join-like operations.  



![Mermaid Diagram: flowchart](images/diagram-4-f89a4766.png)



- **Trade-Offs**  
  - Denormalization speeds up reads but can complicate updates.  
  - Strict relationships become more **manual** in NoSQL.

---

### üîç **Query Approaches Comparison**

- **SQL Example** (Oracle):
  ```python
  import oracledb

  # Connect to Oracle
  with oracledb.connect(
      user="admin", 
      password="secret", 
      dsn="localhost:1521/ORCLPDB"
  ) as conn:
      with conn.cursor() as cursor:
          cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_id = :id", {"id": 1001})
          for row in cursor:
              print(row)
  ```

- **CQL Example** (Cassandra):
  ```python
  from cassandra.cluster import Cluster

  cluster = Cluster(['127.0.0.1'])
  session = cluster.connect("my_keyspace")

  rows = session.execute("SELECT * FROM orders_by_customer WHERE customer_id = %s", [123])
  for row in rows:
      print(row)
  ```

- **Performance Considerations**: 
  - SQL join-based queries vs. NoSQL‚Äôs denormalized approach.  
  - Indexing strategies differ significantly (secondary indexes in Cassandra vs. B-tree indexes in Oracle).

---

### üî® **Day 9 Hands-On Exercises**

Provide exercises at all three tiers:

1. **üîç Beginner**  
   1. Identify which type of database is best for a **user profile** that can have varying fields (e.g., hobbies, preferences).  
   2. Write a **simple SELECT** statement in Oracle.  
   3. Write a **simple GET** operation in DynamoDB or Cassandra.

2. **üß© Intermediate**  
   1. Convert a small relational schema (Customers, Orders) into a **document model** for MongoDB.  
   2. Demonstrate **denormalizing** a table for Cassandra.  
   3. Compare queries in Oracle and MongoDB for the same dataset.

3. **üí° Advanced/SRE**  
   1. Evaluate **read/write throughput** requirements for a retail application to decide whether to use Oracle or Cassandra.  
   2. Construct a small Python script that inserts sample data into Oracle and then **copies** that data to MongoDB.  
   3. Tune consistency levels in Cassandra (LOCAL_QUORUM, EACH_QUORUM) and observe the trade-offs.

---

### üöß **Day 9 Troubleshooting Scenarios**

1. **Scenario 1**: A microservice tries to perform a ‚Äújoin-like‚Äù query in DynamoDB but times out.  
   - **Symptoms**: Slow response, eventually leading to request timeouts.  
   - **Diagnostic**: Check the access pattern. Realize you‚Äôre effectively trying to do a join across two tables in a key-value store.  
   - **Resolution**: Redesign the data model to store the needed data in a single item or use a secondary index.  

2. **Scenario 2**: Oracle concurrency error when too many transactions update the same row.  
   - **Symptoms**: Deadlocks or ‚Äúsnapshot too old‚Äù errors.  
   - **Diagnostic**: Check **ACID transaction** loads and row-level locking.  
   - **Resolution**: Reduce contention, consider queue-based updates or segment data to reduce lock collisions.  

3. **Scenario 3**: Inconsistent reads across Cassandra clusters.  
   - **Symptoms**: Some reads return updated data, while others return stale data.  
   - **Diagnostic**: Eventual consistency requires time to propagate writes across nodes.  
   - **Resolution**: Adjust **consistency level** (e.g., QUORUM) or handle stale reads in the application logic.

### ‚ùì **Day 9 Frequently Asked Questions**

**üîç Beginner**  
1. *Why is NoSQL sometimes faster than SQL?*  
   - Because NoSQL often uses **denormalized data** and simpler query paths, reducing the need for multi-table joins.  

2. *Can NoSQL handle transactions at all?*  
   - Many do, though typically they handle them differently (e.g., MongoDB multi-document transactions, Cassandra lightweight transactions).  

3. *What does ‚Äúschema-on-read‚Äù mean?*  
   - Data can be stored **without a strict schema** and the structure is determined when **querying**.

**üß© Intermediate**  
1. *Can we run complex analytics on NoSQL?*  
   - It‚Äôs possible but can be more challenging. Often, you move data into analytics platforms or use specialized engines.  
2. *How do we handle foreign key constraints in NoSQL?*  
   - Usually, we handle them **in application code**, since NoSQL solutions often don‚Äôt enforce referential integrity.  
3. *When do we choose a key-value store over a document store?*  
   - Key-value is perfect for **simple lookups** without the need for complex queries. Document stores offer more flexible querying.

**üí° Advanced/SRE**  
1. *How do we ensure high availability in a distributed NoSQL database?*  
   - Configure **replication** across multiple nodes or data centers, set the appropriate **consistency level**, and monitor node health.  
2. *Is it ever necessary to ‚Äúshard‚Äù Oracle?*  
   - Oracle supports **partitioning** and **sharding** solutions. Large-scale setups may distribute data across multiple Oracle instances.  
3. *How do we unify logging and monitoring for multi-database environments?*  
   - Centralize logs using a platform like **ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** or **Prometheus/Grafana** and ensure each database‚Äôs metrics are collected consistently.

| Ideal Use Case     | Financial apps, OLTP, analytics  | Web-scale apps needing flexible throughput      |

---

#### 3. **Kafka and Streaming Platforms**

- **Why Kafka?**: Event-driven architectures, real-time data ingestion.  
- **Event Sourcing**: Instead of updating a DB in real time, events are stored in Kafka for asynchronous processing.  
- **Comparison**: Kafka isn‚Äôt a database but complements databases by decoupling producers and consumers.

---

#### 4. **Performance Characteristics**

- **Read/Write Optimization**:  
  - **Oracle**: Balanced read/write but typically slower writes than Cassandra for extremely large workloads.  
  - **Cassandra**: Highly optimized for writes, also good for large-scale read distribution.  

- **Latency vs. Throughput**:  
  - Oracle focuses on guaranteeing consistency, sometimes adding latency.  
  - Cassandra thrives on throughput across a distributed cluster.

---

#### 5. **Scaling Approaches**

- **Vertical Scaling**: Add CPU, RAM to a single machine.  
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Add more machines; distribute data.  
- **Sharding**: Splitting data across multiple nodes or shards (can be done in both SQL and NoSQL).  



![Mermaid Diagram: flowchart](images/diagram-7-925340e2.png)



---

#### 6. **High Availability Configurations**

- **Oracle**: Data Guard, RAC (Real Application Clusters), backups for failover.  
- **Cassandra**: Replication Factor, multi-datacenter replication, no single point of failure.

### üî® **Day 10 Hands-On Exercises**

1. **üîç Beginner**  
   1. Configure **monitoring** for a small Oracle instance (e.g., using built-in performance views).  
   2. Compare **backup** processes (Oracle RMAN vs. Cassandra snapshots).  
   3. Practice a basic **scaling exercise** in a local Cassandra cluster (add a node and watch data redistribute).

2. **üß© Intermediate**  
   1. **Design** a high availability setup: Oracle Data Guard or Cassandra multi-node replication.  
   2. Implement a **migration** from a small Oracle table to DynamoDB using Python.  
   3. Set up **basic Kafka** integration to capture changes from a Cassandra table.

3. **üí° Advanced/SRE**  
   1. **Benchmark** read vs. write performance in Oracle vs. Cassandra using a performance testing tool (e.g., JMeter or custom Python scripts).  
   2. Automate a **multi-database incident response** plan (script that detects node failure in Cassandra and triggers Oracle failover if needed).  
   3. Create an **end-to-end monitoring dashboard** in Grafana showing metrics from Oracle, Cassandra, and Kafka.

### üöß **Day 10 Troubleshooting Scenarios**

1. **Scenario 1**: A data ingestion pipeline (Kafka ‚Üí Cassandra) fails intermittently due to **high write throughput**.  
   - **Symptoms**: Dropped messages, high latency.  
   - **Diagnostic**: Check Cassandra‚Äôs logs for write timeouts, monitor compactions.  
   - **Resolution**: Increase cluster size, tune write consistency level, optimize compaction.

2. **Scenario 2**: An Oracle standby database (Data Guard) is not in sync.  
   - **Symptoms**: Lag behind primary, potential data loss if primary fails.  
   - **Diagnostic**: Investigate network latency or redo transport errors.  
   - **Resolution**: Reconfigure Data Guard for synchronous mode (if feasible) or tune network settings.

3. **Scenario 3**: A multi-database transaction fails partway‚ÄîOracle commits, but Cassandra does not.  
   - **Symptoms**: Inconsistent data across systems.  
   - **Diagnostic**: The distributed transaction had no standard 2PC (two-phase commit) bridging Oracle and Cassandra.  
   - **Resolution**: Implement **saga pattern** or other distributed transaction compensations.

### ‚ùì **Day 10 Frequently Asked Questions**

**üîç Beginner**  
1. *Do I need to learn a new query language for NoSQL?*  
   - Often yes. DynamoDB has a proprietary API or PartiQL, Cassandra uses CQL, etc.  
2. *How do I monitor a Cassandra cluster with basic tools?*  
   - Use built-in `nodetool` commands, plus external exporters like Prometheus.  
3. *Is Oracle still relevant in a NoSQL world?*  
   - Absolutely. Oracle remains crucial for **mission-critical** transactional systems.

**üß© Intermediate**  
1. *Can Kafka store data indefinitely like a database?*  
   - Kafka can **persist data** for a configurable retention, but it‚Äôs not intended as a primary store.  
2. *How do I handle Oracle licensing when scaling?*  
   - Oracle typically charges per CPU or per named user. Plan carefully for cost vs. performance.  
3. *What‚Äôs the recommended node size for a Cassandra cluster?*  
   - Smaller, commodity nodes are typical; start with a 3‚Äì5 node cluster and scale out as needed.

**üí° Advanced/SRE**  
1. *How do we handle global distribution for Oracle?*  
   - Use Data Guard or GoldenGate for replication across regions. Latency can be a limiting factor.  
2. *How do I unify a backup strategy for multiple databases?*  
   - Orchestrate with automation tools (e.g., Ansible), ensuring each DB‚Äôs backup occurs in a coordinated window.  
3. *Should we use 2PC across Oracle and Cassandra?*  
   - Traditional 2PC doesn‚Äôt scale well in distributed NoSQL. You‚Äôd consider **saga patterns** or eventual consistency designs.

### üî• **Comprehensive SRE-Specific Scenario (Days 9-10)**

**Situation**: A global e-commerce platform uses:
- **Oracle** for order management (transactions).  
- **Cassandra** for product catalogs and user sessions.  
- **Kafka** for streaming user click events to a real-time analytics pipeline.

**Incident**: During a large promotional event, the system experiences:  
- Delayed order confirmations (Oracle side).  
- Partially updated product catalog (Cassandra side).  
- Gaps in the analytics dashboards (Kafka backlog).

#### Monitoring Metrics
- **Oracle**: High active sessions, potential row lock contention, increased wait times.  
- **Cassandra**: Write timeouts, node gossip issues.  
- **Kafka**: Growing backlog, consumer lag.

#### Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Oracle**: Check AWR report or queries causing locks. Possibly split large transactions or increase CPU resources.  
2. **Cassandra**: Add nodes to handle extra write throughput; verify replication settings.  
3. **Kafka**: Scale consumer groups or use partition rebalancing.

#### Resolution
- System rebalanced through horizontal scale of Cassandra, concurrency tuning in Oracle, and Kafka consumer scaling.  
- Full service restored with minimal user impact.

**SRE Takeaway**: Prepare for multi-database surges with a robust capacity plan and real-time alerts across all systems.
