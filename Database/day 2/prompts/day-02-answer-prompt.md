## Special Considerations for Noah's Day 2 Material

When generating explanations, make sure to:

1. Reference Noah's personal anecdotes and realizations, such as:
   - "Ask me how I know this. No, seriously: I once forgot `ROLLBACK` existed and manually tried to fix a partial update by re-updating everything."
   - "I once found a poor developer's session holding an exclusive lock on a high-traffic table. The code had an open transaction for hours."
   - "I tried chaining a bunch of WHEN MATCHED lines once. I ended up basically rewriting my entire business logic in a single MERGE statement."

2. Incorporate Noah's analogies:
   - Shopping Cart analogy for transaction control
   - "Grumpy trolls" under rows for locking behavior
   - "New Club Membership" for INSERT operations
   - "Correcting a Typo" for UPDATE operations
   - "Kicking a member out" for DELETE operations
   - "Membership Roster Sync" for MERGE operations

3. Include Noah's SRE perspective on:
   - Transaction discipline in production environments
   - Monitoring for blocking sessions
   - Session kill decision making
   - Balancing business impact with technical interventions

4. Reference specific database tools and views mentioned by Noah:
   - V$SESSION for identifying active sessions
   - V$LOCK for spotting lock contentions
   - ALTER SYSTEM KILL SESSION for terminating problematic sessions
   - DBMS_STATS for managing statistics

## Specific References to Diagrams in Quiz Questions

Make sure to properly include and reference all diagrams from the quiz questions, particularly:

1. **Question 4**: INSERT Flow diagram showing the steps of an INSERT operation
2. **Question 7**: Row-Level Locks diagram showing session blocking
3. **Question 9**: Noah's session kill decision tree flowchart
4. **Question 13**: Transaction steps sequence diagram
5. **Question 18**: Data consistency troubleshooting flowchart

When explaining these diagram-based questions, be sure to reference specific elements and steps shown in the diagrams and how they relate to Noah's explanations in the Day 2 material.
