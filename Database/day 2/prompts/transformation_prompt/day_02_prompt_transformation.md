### 🔁 Prompt 2: *Follow-the-Sun Chronicles* Day 2 – Noah & the Data Mutants

> You're continuing a technical training series called **The Follow-the-Sun Chronicles**, where each day of instruction is led by a different fictional SRE character from a different region.
>
> For **Day 2**, your character is:
> - **Name:** Noah  
> - **Location:** Australia (Sydney)  
> - **Time:** 08:00 AEDT  
> - **Role:** Observability-obsessed SRE with a passion for reliable data mutation  
> - **Personality:** Calm, meticulous, lightly sarcastic. Think "writes unit tests for shell scripts."  
>
> Your goal is to **rewrite the Day 2 SRE Database Training Module**, which covers **Data Manipulation Language (DML)** topics including `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, and transaction management—**Oracle-focused**, but with comparisons to PostgreSQL and SQL Server.
>
> **Constraints and style:**
> 1. Preserve the original document's **structure** and **technical completeness**:  
>    - Learning Objectives (Beginner, Intermediate, SRE)  
>    - Core Concepts  
>    - SQL Syntax examples  
>    - Support/SRE Applications  
>    - System Impact & Misconceptions  
>    - SQL dialect comparisons  
> 2. Write from **Noah’s perspective**, with light narration and commentary woven through each section. Noah is both **learning and teaching**, clarifying things in his own words.
> 3. Begin with a **short incident** involving data inconsistency due to missing `COMMIT`, triggering Noah’s involvement.  
> 4. Use **Mermaid diagrams** as in the original document:  
>    - Use `&commat;` instead of `@` in any email addresses  
>    - All `sequenceDiagram` blocks must include `autonumber`  
> 5. Use **code blocks** for SQL examples and shell-like commands.  
> 6. Every core DML command (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `MERGE`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, `SAVEPOINT`) should include:  
>    - Real-world beginner analogy  
>    - Mermaid visual diagram  
>    - Support/SRE relevance  
>    - SQL syntax + cross-dialect notes  
> 7. Include a **sequenceDiagram** representing a failed multi-step transaction and its recovery using `SAVEPOINT` and `ROLLBACK`.
> 8. Wrap with a **handoff note to Aanya in India**, who will handle Day 3’s session on database design and normalization.
>
> **Tone:**  
> - Precise, dryly witty  
> - Slightly condescending toward bad data hygiene  
> - Friendly enough to be trusted by new engineers  
>
> This is not a tutorial, blog, or essay—it’s a **structured training document disguised as a character-driven SRE drama**.

With this prompt, Day 2 becomes Noah’s masterclass in doing DML the right way—or, in his words, *“the way that doesn’t destroy production history and your reputation in one transaction.”*

Want the Day 3 version for Aanya next? I’ve got one brewing with ER diagrams and judgmental glances at unnormalized tables.
