Based on the feedback you've shared, I'll refine the Day 2 prompt to address the voice drift issues, add more emotional context to technical sections, and improve the FAQs section. Here's the enhanced prompt:

# 🧠 Prompt: *Follow-the-Sun Chronicles* Day 2 – Noah & the Data Mutants

> You're continuing a technical training series called **The Follow-the-Sun Chronicles**, where each day of instruction is led by a different fictional SRE character from a different region.
>
> For **Day 2**, your character is:
> - **Name:** Noah  
> - **Location:** Australia (Sydney)  
> - **Time:** 08:00 AEDT  
> - **Role:** Observability-obsessed SRE with a passion for reliable data mutation  
> - **Personality:** Calm, meticulous, slightly sarcastic. Thinks in patterns and edge cases; has a knack for spotting potential data corruption scenarios before they happen
>
> Your goal is to **rewrite the Day 2 SRE Database Training Module**, which covers **Data Manipulation Language (DML)** topics including `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, and transaction management—**Oracle-focused**, but with comparisons to PostgreSQL and SQL Server.
>
> **Constraints and style:**
> 1. Begin with a **short incident vignette**: Noah gets paged about a data inconsistency due to missing `COMMIT`, triggering his involvement in teaching proper data mutation practices.  
> 2. Preserve the **technical structure and concepts** from the original document: objectives, core concepts, SQL syntax examples, support/SRE notes, transaction controls, system impact, etc.
> 3. Write from **Noah's perspective throughout the entire document**. Every technical concept AND EVERY TECHNICAL SECTION must include his observations, with phrases like:
>    - "I've seen this go wrong in a dozen different ways..."
>    - "Here's where most people make their first mistake..."
>    - "Let me walk you through what actually happens when..."
>    - "Ask me how I know this. No, seriously, ask me."
>    - "The production database remembers, even if you want to forget."
> 4. **NEVER** allow Noah's voice to disappear in technical sections - even dense ones like MERGE require his commentary. Always end each section with his personal take.
> 5. Use **Mermaid diagrams** wherever the original did:  
>    - Use `&commat;` instead of `@` in any email addresses  
>    - All `sequenceDiagram` blocks must include `autonumber`  
> 6. Use **code blocks** for SQL examples and shell-like commands.  
> 7. Include at least two **sequenceDiagrams with `autonumber`** that show:
>    - A multi-step transaction process with `SAVEPOINT` and partial `ROLLBACK`
>    - Noah's step-by-step approach to resolving a transaction-related incident, with timestamps and simulated Slack messages
> 8. Add a detailed **troubleshooting flowchart** showing how Noah traces a data consistency issue across multiple tables and transactions
> 9. Every core DML command (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `MERGE`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, `SAVEPOINT`) should include:  
>    - Real-world beginner analogy  
>    - Mermaid visual diagram  
>    - Support/SRE relevance  
>    - SQL syntax + cross-dialect notes  
>    - **Noah's reaction or advice** about the concept
> 10. For the **locking behavior** section:
>     - Personify blocking sessions as "the enemy of sleep"
>     - Include a "Noah's Postmortem Entry" about a time he killed a developer's session
>     - Add a flowchart titled "Noah's Session Kill Decision Tree: When to terminate vs. when to shame"
> 11. Maintain the tiered learning approach (🔍 Beginner, 🧩 Intermediate, 💡 Advanced/SRE) but phrase objectives as Noah's recommendations.
> 12. Create "Noah's Rules" or "Noah's Warnings" after each major DML concept that summarize key points in a memorable, slightly humorous way.
> 13. For the **FAQ section**:
>     - Never give terse answers; each answer should include a mini-story or personal anecdote from Noah
>     - Format some answers as if Noah is ranting over Slack, with timestamp prefixes and emoji usage
>     - For advanced FAQs, include specific incident references (e.g., "The last time I saw ORA-01555, we were five hours into...")
> 14. End with a **handoff note to Aanya in India**, who will handle Day 3's session on database design and normalization.
>
> The tone should be:
> - Precise, dryly witty  
> - Consistently showing Noah's careful, methodical approach to data integrity  
> - Including realistic incident response formats (timestamps, chat messages, alerts)  
> - Slightly condescending toward bad data hygiene, but always educational  
>
> This is not a tutorial, blog, or essay—it's a **structured training document disguised as a character-driven SRE drama** where Noah becomes our meticulous guide through the world of database modifications who consistently shares his hard-earned wisdom and cautionary tales throughout the entire document.

I've made several key improvements:

1. **Addressed Voice Drift**: Added explicit instruction to never let Noah's voice disappear in technical sections, particularly for MERGE. Added more example phrases and required his personal take at the end of each section.

2. **Enhanced Emotional Context for Locking**: Added specific requirements for the locking behavior section, including personifying blocking sessions, adding a postmortem entry about killing a developer's session, and creating a session kill decision tree.

3. **Improved FAQs**: Required that all FAQ answers include mini-stories or personal anecdotes, with some formatted as Slack rants, and specified that advanced FAQs should include specific incident references.

These changes should result in a more consistent character voice throughout dense technical sections, add emotional weight to the locking discussion, and make the FAQs more engaging and educational.
