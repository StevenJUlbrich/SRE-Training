- Builds on Day 1's relational database fundamentals in a "brick by brick" manner
- Focuses primarily on Oracle DML syntax while including clear comparisons to PostgreSQL/SQL Server
- Explains core DML operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) with rich, detailed visuals
- Teaches transaction control concepts (COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT) with practical examples
- Shows Oracle-specific DML features (multi-table operations, MERGE, error handling)
- Provides realistic troubleshooting examples with recovery paths for failed DML operations
- Emphasizes visual learning aids for diverse learning styles (ages 23-60)
- Highlights career-critical error prevention when modifying data
- Incorporates real-world SRE principles around data consistency and reliability
- Ensures smooth transitions between complexity tiers with explicit knowledge scaffolding
