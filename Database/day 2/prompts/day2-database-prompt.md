## Mermaid Diagram Generation Guidelines

When creating Mermaid diagrams for the training module, follow these formatting rules to ensure proper rendering:

1. **Always Enclose Node Labels in Quotes**
   * If a node label has **parentheses** `( )`, **colons** `:`, or **HTML tags** like `<br/>`, wrap it in quotes:
   ```
   A["INSERT Statement"]
   B["Transaction: COMMIT"]
   C["Line1<br/>Line2"]
   ```

2. **Use Self-Closing `<br/>` Tags**
   * For line breaks in node labels, use `<br/>` (with a slash) instead of `<br>`.
   * Keep them inside quotes: `["Line1<br/>Line2"]`.

3. **Subgraph Titles**
   * Always wrap subgraph titles in quotes:
   ```
   subgraph "Transaction Process"
     S1["Begin Transaction"]
     S2["Execute DML"]
   end
   ```

4. **Use Separate Lines for Each Arrow or Connection**
   * Place each connection on its own line:
   ```
   A --> B
   B --> C
   ```
   * Avoid: `A --> B --> C`

5. **No Raw Text Immediately After `subgraph`**
   * Add nodes for text inside subgraphs instead of raw text:
   ```
   subgraph "DML Operations"
     N["INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE"]
   end
   ```

6. **Avoid Ambiguous Characters in the Flow**
   * Keep characters like `#`, `?`, or additional punctuation inside quotes if needed.

7. **Simplify Complex Diagrams**
   * Break down complex relationships into simpler sections.
   * Test diagrams incrementally to ensure proper rendering.

## Mermaid Diagram Types for DML Training

1. **DML Operation Flowcharts**:
   ```mermaid
   flowchart TD
     subgraph "INSERT Process"
       A["Parse SQL"]
       B["Validate Data"]
       C["Allocate Space"]
       D["Write Data"]
       E["Update Indexes"]
     end
     
     A --> B
     B --> C
     C --> D
     D --> E
   ```

2. **Transaction Sequence Diagrams**:
   ```mermaid
   sequenceDiagram
     participant Client
     participant Transaction
     participant Database
     
     Client->>Transaction: BEGIN
     Client->>Database: INSERT Data
     Client->>Database: UPDATE Data
     Client->>Transaction: COMMIT
     Transaction->>Database: Make Changes Permanent
   ```

3. **Lock Interaction Diagrams**:
   ```mermaid
   sequenceDiagram
     participant Transaction1
     participant Resource
     participant Transaction2
     
     Transaction1->>Resource: Acquire Lock
     Transaction2->>Resource: Request Lock
     Resource-->>Transaction2: Wait
     Transaction1->>Resource: Release Lock
     Resource-->>Transaction2: Grant Lock
   ```

4. **Error Handling Flowcharts**:
   ```mermaid
   flowchart TD
     A["Execute DML"] --> B{Success?}
     B -->|Yes| C["COMMIT"]
     B -->|No| D["Error Handling"]
     D --> E["Identify Error Type"]
     E --> F["Recovery Strategy"]
     F --> G["ROLLBACK"]
   ```

5. **Data Dictionary View Relationships**:
   ```mermaid
   classDiagram
     class V$SESSION {
      +SID
      +SERIAL#
      +STATUS
    }
    class V$LOCK {
      +SID
      +TYPE
      +ID1
    }
    class V$TRANSACTION {
      +SID
      +USED_UBLK
      +STATUS
    }
    V$SESSION "1" -- "n" V$LOCK: holds
    V$SESSION "1" -- "1" V$TRANSACTION: has
   ```

Remember to maintain the "brick by brick" learning approach, ensuring each concept builds logically on previous ones and that Oracle-specific details enhance rather than overwhelm the fundamental concepts.

## Invocations Statement
Generate a comprehensive Day 2 database training module focused on Data Manipulation Language (DML) with Oracle as the primary focus and comparisons to PostgreSQL and SQL Server. Follow the "brick by brick" learning approach, building on Day 1's relational fundamentals and progressing through INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations and transaction control. 

Include detailed Oracle-specific content including DML syntax variations, transaction management, bulk operations, and recovery strategies. Structure the content with clear visual aids, properly formatted Mermaid diagrams for all key concepts, and examples at beginner (üîç), intermediate (üß©), and SRE (üí°) levels. 

Create visually engaging Mermaid diagrams following the formatting guidelines to illustrate key concepts like DML operations, transaction flows, lock interactions, error handling, and dictionary view relationships. Include realistic troubleshooting scenarios with visual flowcharts and sequence diagrams.

Ensure all sections have thorough Oracle-specific details while maintaining accessibility for learners with diverse experience levels (ages 23-58, experience 2-20 years).
