## **(üîç) Beginner-Level Questions (7)**

---

### **Question 1 (üîç, Multiple Choice)**
**Topic:** Basic Transaction Control

Noah emphasized the importance of ‚Äútransaction discipline‚Äù so that data changes become visible to everyone else. Which statement best represents the final step needed after running an `INSERT`?

A. Wait for auto-commit to happen when you exit the session  
B. Issue a `SAVEPOINT` so other users see the data  
C. Issue a `COMMIT` to make the changes permanent  
D. There is no final step; Oracle commits all changes automatically

B. It completely empties your cart, discarding all items  
C. It marks a checkpoint so you can revert to a previous cart state if needed  
D. It auto-commits just the newly added items  

---

### **Question 3 (üîç, True/False)**
**Topic:** Uncommitted Transactions

Noah warns about the dangers of leaving an uncommitted transaction open for too long. True or false: An uncommitted transaction can block other sessions and remain invisible to analytics until it is either committed or rolled back.

A. True  
B. False

---

## **(üß©) Intermediate-Level Questions (7)**

---

### **Question 8 (üß©, Multiple Choice)**
**Topic:** Concurrency & Multi-Step Updates

Noah warns that long-running updates can cause lock contention and page-outs. Which approach best reduces blocking issues for large updates?

A. Issue one huge `UPDATE` on millions of rows without a commit until completion  
B. Use small, batched updates with periodic commits  
C. Acquire a table-level lock to ensure no one else can read the table  
D. Disable all constraints before running the update  

---

### **Question 9 (üß©, Ordering with Diagram)**
**Topic:** Killing Sessions

Look at Noah‚Äôs session kill decision tree:



![Mermaid Diagram: flowchart](images/diagram-3-8557e550.png)



Arrange these steps in correct order when you find a suspicious session hogging locks:

A. Check if the session is genuinely stuck  
B. Document in postmortem  
C. Decide whether to kill the session  
D. Give the developer time to commit or roll back if it‚Äôs low impact  

---

### **Question 10 (üß©, Fill-in-the-Blank)**
**Topic:** Large DELETE Concerns

Complete Noah‚Äôs cautionary statement:

> ‚ÄúRunning a single massive `DELETE` that removes millions of rows can cause ________ for everyone else, because the transaction holds locks too long.‚Äù

A. index corruption  
B. concurrency nightmares  
C. data dictionary purges  
D. partial commits  

---

### **Question 11 (üß©, True/False)**
**Topic:** Truncate vs. Delete

Noah notes that `TRUNCATE` in Oracle is considered DDL, not DML. True or false: `TRUNCATE` can be rolled back like a normal `DELETE`.

A. True  
B. False  

---

### **Question 12 (üß©, Multiple Choice)**
**Topic:** Data Dictionary & Lock Analysis

Which Oracle data dictionary or performance view does Noah most often use to identify blocking sessions or row-level locks?

A. `ALL_CONSTRAINTS`  
B. `ALL_OBJECTS`  
C. `V$LOCK`  
D. `DBA_TABLES`

---

### **Question 19 (üí°, True/False)**
