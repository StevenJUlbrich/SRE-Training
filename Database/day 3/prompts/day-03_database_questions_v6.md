# 📝 SRE Database Training Module - Day 3: Quiz Questions on Database Design & Normalization with Oracle Focus

## 🧑‍🏫 Role
You are an expert database architect creating assessment questions for a Day 3 training module on Database Design Principles and Normalization. These questions will test knowledge from beginner to advanced/SRE-level concepts covered in the Day 3 material, with Oracle as the primary database focus.

## 🎯 Objective
Create a comprehensive set of quiz questions that:
- Tests understanding of core database design principles and entity-relationship modeling
- Assesses knowledge of normalization forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF) with an Oracle focus
- Evaluates application of concepts to support and SRE scenarios in Oracle environments
- Provides progressive difficulty across all three learning levels
- Includes a variety of question types and formats
- Tests awareness of when to apply normalization versus when to consider denormalization

## 📝 Quiz Structure Requirements

Create exactly 20 quiz questions with the following distribution:
- 7 Beginner-level questions (🔍)
- 7 Intermediate-level questions (🧩)
- 6 Advanced/SRE-level questions (💡)

Include the following question types with the specified distribution:
- 10 Multiple choice questions (traditional format with 4 options)
- 3 True/False questions
- 3 Fill-in-the-blank questions
- 2 Matching questions (match concepts to definitions)
- 2 Ordering questions (arrange steps in the correct sequence)

Each question must:
- Clearly indicate its difficulty level with the appropriate emoji
- Connect directly to content covered in the Day 3 material
- Be clearly written and unambiguous
- Include relevant context for scenario-based questions
- Include Oracle-specific content where appropriate

## Quiz Content Focus Areas

1. **Database Design Principles**
   - Clarity, consistency, and non-redundancy
   - Entity integrity and referential integrity
   - Business rules implementation through design
   - Design trade-offs in Oracle environments

2. **Entity-Relationship Modeling**
   - Entities and attributes
   - Relationship types (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many)
   - Converting ER diagrams to relational schemas
   - Oracle implementation of relationships

3. **Keys and Constraints in Oracle**
   - Primary keys (natural vs. surrogate)
   - Foreign keys and referential integrity
   - Unique constraints
   - Check constraints and NOT NULL constraints

4. **Normalization Forms**
   - First Normal Form (atomic values, no repeating groups)
   - Second Normal Form (removing partial dependencies)
   - Third Normal Form (removing transitive dependencies)
   - Implementation in Oracle

5. **Denormalization and Performance**
   - Identifying when to denormalize
   - Common denormalization techniques
   - Performance impacts in Oracle
   - SRE considerations for schema design

## Question Distribution Requirements

Ensure a good distribution of questions across:
- All concept areas covered in Day 3
- Different cognitive levels (recall, understanding, application, analysis)
- Oracle-specific vs. general relational database concepts
- Practical scenarios vs. theoretical knowledge

Consider including questions about the Mermaid diagrams presented in the training. For example, asking learners to identify correct or incorrect elements in a diagram, or to identify which diagram best represents a particular concept or normal form.

DO NOT include the correct answers or explanations in the questions themselves. These will be provided in a separate answer key document.

## Invocations Statement
Generate a comprehensive set of 20 quiz questions to assess knowledge of Day 3 database training content focused on Database Design Principles and Normalization with an Oracle focus. Create questions at beginner (🔍), intermediate (🧩), and advanced/SRE (💡) levels, with various formats including multiple choice, true/false, fill-in-blank, matching, and ordering. Focus on database design principles, entity-relationship modeling, normalization forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF), and denormalization considerations, while including practical support and SRE scenarios. Ensure all questions are clearly written, unambiguous, and directly relevant to the Day 3 material.
