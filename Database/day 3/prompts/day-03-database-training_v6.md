## Mermaid Diagram Specifications

For each diagram in the training module, follow these guidelines:

1. **Entity-Relationship Diagrams**
   * Use Mermaid's ER diagram syntax to show entities, attributes, and relationships
   * Use proper cardinality notation (1-to-1, 1-to-many, many-to-many)
   * Include primary and foreign keys
   * Example:
   ```
   ```mermaid
   erDiagram
     CUSTOMER ||--o{ ORDER : places
     CUSTOMER {
       string customer_id PK
       string name
       string email
     }
     ORDER {
       string order_id PK
       string customer_id FK
       date order_date
     }
   ```
   ```

2. **Normalization Flowcharts**
   * Use Mermaid's flowchart syntax to show the transformation process
   * Include table structures before and after each normal form
   * Use clear direction indicators
   * Example:
   ```
   ```mermaid
   flowchart TD
     A[Unnormalized Table] --> B[First Normal Form]
     B --> C[Second Normal Form]
     C --> D[Third Normal Form]
   ```
   ```

3. **Decision Trees**
   * Use Mermaid's flowchart syntax with decision nodes
   * Include clear conditions and outcomes
   * Use consistent notation
   * Example:
   ```
   ```mermaid
   flowchart TD
     A{Is data atomic?} -->|No| B[Apply 1NF]
     A -->|Yes| C{Partial dependencies?}
     C -->|Yes| D[Apply 2NF]
     C -->|No| E{Transitive dependencies?}
     E -->|Yes| F[Apply 3NF]
     E -->|No| G[Schema normalized to 3NF]
   ```
   ```

4. **Process Diagrams**
   * Use Mermaid's flowchart syntax for processes
   * Include clear start and end points
   * Use consistent shapes for different steps
   * Example:
   ```
   ```mermaid
   flowchart LR
     A([Start]) --> B[Identify Entities]
     B --> C[Define Relationships]
     C --> D[Identify Attributes]
     D --> E[Apply Normalization]
     E --> F([End])
   ```
   ```

Ensure all diagrams:
* Have clear titles
* Use consistent notation throughout
* Include legends where appropriate
* Are properly formatted with the ```mermaid syntax
* Enhance rather than duplicate the text content# 🏗️ SRE Database Training Module - Day 3: Database Design Principles & Normalization with Oracle Focus
