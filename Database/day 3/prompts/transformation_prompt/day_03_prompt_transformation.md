# 🧱 Prompt 3: *Follow-the-Sun Chronicles* – Day 3: Aanya & the War on Redundancy

> You are continuing the serialized training series called **The Follow-the-Sun Chronicles**, where each day is led by a fictional SRE or data engineer in a different region of the world.
>
> For **Day 3**, your character is:
> - **Name:** Aanya  
> - **Location:** India (Bengaluru)  
> - **Time:** 09:45 IST  
> - **Role:** Data modeling specialist, obsessed with elegant schema design and normalization  
> - **Personality:** Analytical, articulate, a little smug about her ER diagrams being “self-documenting.”  
>
> You are rewriting the **Day 3 SRE Database Training Module**, focused on:
> - Database design principles  
> - Normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF)  
> - Entity-Relationship modeling  
> - Keys and constraints (natural vs surrogate)  
> - Denormalization strategies  
>
> **Constraints & style:**
> 1. Follow the **original technical structure** closely:  
>    - Tiered Learning Objectives (Beginner → Advanced/SRE)  
>    - Concept explanations, diagrams, SQL examples, SRE applications  
>    - Misconceptions, System Impact, Dialect Notes  
> 2. Narrate from **Aanya’s point of view**:  
>    - She is explaining each concept as a seasoned mentor with high standards and even higher ERD hygiene.  
>    - Sprinkle in her commentary about why normalization is essential, and why denormalization is *sometimes* acceptable, but mostly evil.  
> 3. Begin with a short vignette: Aanya inherits a data structure with redundant address fields in multiple tables and reacts accordingly (with disdain and a whiteboard).  
> 4. Use **Mermaid diagrams** wherever used in the original:
>    - Include `&commat;` instead of `@` in email addresses  
>    - All `sequenceDiagram` blocks must include `autonumber`  
> 5. Each concept (e.g. 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, ER modeling) must include:  
>    - A relatable analogy  
>    - A visual diagram (Mermaid)  
>    - A brief technical explanation  
>    - SQL schema examples  
>    - Real-world support/SRE application insight  
> 6. Include a **Mermaid flowchart** that walks through the normalization process (Unnormalized → 1NF → 2NF → 3NF).  
> 7. Include a **troubleshooting scenario** where over-normalization leads to slow reads, prompting selective denormalization. Aanya makes this decision with reluctance.  
> 8. End with a **handoff note to Luis in Spain**, who will cover SQL JOINs on Day 4.
>
> **Tone:**
> - Precise, elegant, opinionated  
> - Slightly sarcastic about bad schemas and spreadsheets passed off as databases  
> - Teaches through **clean design and firm rules**—but isn’t afraid to break them when justified
>
> The result should read like a **high-quality technical training guide** that’s been **narrated by a judgmental but helpful schema purist**.
