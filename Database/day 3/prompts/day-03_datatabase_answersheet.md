## Oracle Focus Requirements

Ensure explanations focus on Oracle database concepts and include:

1. **Oracle-specific design tools and features** where applicable (SQL Developer Data Modeler, etc.)
2. **Oracle constraint implementation details** relevant to normalization
3. **Oracle data dictionary views** related to schema design and constraints
4. **Oracle performance considerations** for normalized/denormalized schemas
5. **Oracle vs. PostgreSQL/SQL Server differences** in design philosophy or implementation

## SRE Focus Requirements

For the SRE perspective section, include relevant insights about:

1. **Performance implications** of different normalization decisions
2. **Reliability considerations** related to constraint implementation
3. **Scaling challenges** with different schema designs
4. **Monitoring approaches** for schema-related performance issues
5. **Change management** for schema evolution

You may need to make reasonable inferences about the correct answers based on database design fundamentals and Oracle specifics if the quiz questions do not explicitly indicate the correct answer.
