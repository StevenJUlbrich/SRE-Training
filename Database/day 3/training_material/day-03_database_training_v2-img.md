### 💻 Day 3 Concept Breakdown

#### 1. Database Design Principles

- **Clarity**: Clear labeling and straightforward relationships.
- **Consistency**: Consistent naming conventions and data types.
- **Non-Redundancy**: Avoid storing the same data in multiple places.
- **Integrity**: Ensure data accurately reflects the real world.

**🔍 Beginner Analogy**: Organizing files into well-labeled folders, so it’s easy to find the right document.

**🖼️ Visual Representation** (Simple principle summary):



<img src="./images/day03-diagram-2-18ac3f50.svg" alt="Diagram" style="max-width: 600px;">



**🔬 Technical Explanation**: Violations of these principles lead to anomalies, inefficiencies, and complexity in maintenance.

**💼 Support/SRE Application**: Clear, consistent schemas reduce guesswork during troubleshooting.

**🔄 System Impact**: Queries run faster and more predictably; data remains accurate.

**⚠️ Common Misconception**: Some believe these principles only matter in large-scale databases. In reality, they’re essential at all scales.

**📊 Oracle Implementation**: Oracle’s data dictionary (`USER_TABLES`, `ALL_CONSTRAINTS`) helps validate schema structure.

---

#### 2. Entity-Relationship Modeling

**🔍 Beginner Analogy**: A family tree showing who’s related to whom.

**🖼️ Visual Representation** (ER Diagram in Mermaid):



<img src="./images/day03-diagram-3-769c17dd.svg" alt="Diagram" style="max-width: 200px;">



**🔬 Technical Explanation**: Identifies **entities** (tables), their **attributes** (columns), and **relationships** (1-to-1, 1-to-many, many-to-many).

**💼 Support/SRE Application**: Helps you spot potential performance bottlenecks (e.g., overly complex joins).

**🔄 System Impact**: A well-modeled ER structure simplifies queries, ensures data consistency, and scales better.

**⚠️ Common Misconception**: Overlooking many-to-many relationships, which often require **join tables**.

**📊 Oracle Implementation**: Oracle SQL Developer Data Modeler can visually build and manage ERDs.

---

#### 3. Keys and Constraints

**🔍 Beginner Analogy**: A key is a unique ID card; constraints are rules like "must have a valid ID" before entering.

**🖼️ Visual Representation**:



<img src="./images/day03-diagram-4-8c637dee.svg" alt="Diagram" style="max-width: 200px;">



**🔬 Technical Explanation**:

- **Natural Key**: Real-world-based identifier (e.g., SSN).
- **Surrogate Key**: Artificial (auto-increment).
- **Constraints**: **PRIMARY KEY**, **FOREIGN KEY**, **UNIQUE**, **CHECK**, **NOT NULL**.

**💼 Support/SRE Application**: Preventing data corruption is crucial, especially in high-availability systems.

**🔄 System Impact**: Constraints protect integrity; they can add overhead on writes.

**⚠️ Common Misconception**: Believing a surrogate key alone enforces uniqueness if you don’t also declare a unique constraint for natural fields.

**📊 Oracle Implementation**: Use Oracle’s syntax to define constraints, e.g. `ALTER TABLE employees ADD CONSTRAINT pk_emp PRIMARY KEY (emp_id);`

---

#### 4. First Normal Form (1NF)

**🔍 Beginner Analogy**: Each cell in a spreadsheet has exactly one piece of data.

**🖼️ Visual Representation** (Normalization from unnormalized to 1NF):



<img src="./images/day03-diagram-5-fa37afe2.svg" alt="Diagram" style="max-width: 600px;">



**🔬 Technical Explanation**: 1NF enforces **atomicity** (no repeating groups, no multi-valued columns).

**💼 Support/SRE Application**: Simplifies queries and indexing.

**🔄 System Impact**: Reduces risk of anomalies and speeds up searching in columns.

**⚠️ Common Misconception**: Some think 1NF is about having only one table. It’s really about each column holding a single value.

**📊 Oracle Implementation**: Storing multiple phone numbers in a single column is a red flag; instead, create a child table `customer_phones`.

---

#### 5. Second Normal Form (2NF)

**🔍 Beginner Analogy**: If part of a composite key doesn’t apply to some attributes, you’re mixing two concepts in one place.

**🖼️ Visual Representation**:



<img src="./images/day03-diagram-6-b0a9f23a.svg" alt="Diagram" style="max-width: 600px;">



**🔬 Technical Explanation**: For tables with **composite primary keys**, 2NF requires that non-key columns depend on **all** parts of the key.

**💼 Support/SRE Application**: Violations cause data anomalies in multi-column relationships.

**🔄 System Impact**: Minimizes partial redundancy, reducing update overhead.

**⚠️ Common Misconception**: Believing you can skip 2NF if you rarely use composite keys. Always confirm no partial dependencies.

**📊 Oracle Implementation**: If a table’s primary key is `(order_id, product_id)`, ensure non-key columns describe that combination, not just `order_id`.

---

#### 6. Third Normal Form (3NF)

**🔍 Beginner Analogy**: Don’t keep the supplier’s address in the product table. Move it to a supplier table.

**🖼️ Visual Representation**:



<img src="./images/day03-diagram-7-67f8a250.svg" alt="Diagram" style="max-width: 600px;">



**🔬 Technical Explanation**: 3NF eliminates **transitive dependencies** (non-key attributes depending on other non-key attributes).

**💼 Support/SRE Application**: Ensures data updates happen in a single place.

**🔄 System Impact**: Reduces duplication, but can introduce more joins.

**⚠️ Common Misconception**: 3NF is the end-all. In practice, BCNF or partial denormalization might be needed.

**📊 Oracle Implementation**: Typically, you create a separate table for each real-world entity and link them via foreign keys.

---

#### 7. Denormalization Strategies

**🔍 Beginner Analogy**: Keeping a few shortcuts on your computer desktop for frequently used files.

**🖼️ Visual Representation**:



<img src="./images/day03-diagram-8-12249ad8.svg" alt="Diagram" style="max-width: 600px;">



**🔬 Technical Explanation**: Duplicate data in strategic places to reduce join complexity.

**💼 Support/SRE Application**: Denormalizing a heavily accessed reporting table can improve read times.

**🔄 System Impact**: Read performance improves at the cost of more complex, error-prone updates.

**⚠️ Common Misconception**: Overusing denormalization, leading to huge data inconsistencies.

**📊 Oracle Implementation**: Use carefully. Monitor with Oracle’s AWR to confirm the performance benefit outweighs the maintenance cost.

---

### 🔄 Normalization Process in Practice

Below is a Mermaid flowchart showing how an unnormalized table is transformed into 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF:



<img src="./images/day03-diagram-9-6d0519f0.svg" alt="Diagram" style="max-width: 100px;">



**SQL Example** (Oracle):

```sql
-- Unnormalized
CREATE TABLE orders_unnormalized (
  order_id NUMBER,
  customer_info VARCHAR2(200), -- e.g. "John Smith,555-1212"
  order_date DATE
);

-- Normalized approach
CREATE TABLE customers (
  customer_id NUMBER GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
  customer_name VARCHAR2(100) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (customer_id)
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
  order_id NUMBER GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
  customer_id NUMBER,
  order_date DATE,
  PRIMARY KEY (order_id),
  FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
);
```

**Common Pitfalls**:

1. Forgetting to remove repeating groups.
2. Overlooking partial dependencies.
3. Leaving transitive dependencies.

**Verification Techniques**:

- Check each column’s dependency on the primary key.
- Use Oracle constraints to validate referential integrity.
