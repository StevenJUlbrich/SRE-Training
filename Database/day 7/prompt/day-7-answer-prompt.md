3. **Database monitoring tools** like execution plan viewing, statistics analysis tools where relevant
4. **Query optimization approaches** for performance improvement
5. **Index design and maintenance strategies** across different database systems

## SRE Focus Requirements

For the SRE perspective section, include relevant insights about:

1. **Performance implications** of indexing and query design choices
2. **Reliability considerations** related to the question topic
3. **Monitoring approaches** using database-specific tools
4. **Recovery strategies** where applicable to the question
5. **Scaling considerations** for enterprise database environments

## Mermaid Diagram Guidelines for Answer Explanations

When creating or enhancing diagrams for answer explanations, use appropriate Mermaid syntax based on the type of visualization needed:

1. **B-tree Index Structure** for indexing explanations:
```mermaid
flowchart TB
   subgraph "B-tree Index"
     Root["Root Node"]
     Int["Intermediate Nodes"]
     Leaf["Leaf Nodes"]
   end
   Root --> Int
   Int --> Leaf
```

2. **Query Execution Lifecycle** for process explanations:
```mermaid
flowchart LR
   P["Parsing"] --> O["Optimization"]
   O --> E["Execution"]
   E --> F["Fetching"]
```

3. **Index Decision Tree** for decision flow explanations:
```mermaid
flowchart TB
   Start["Query Patterns?"]
   Q1{"Table is large?"}
   Q2{"Filter selectivity high?"}
   MakeIndex["Create or refine index"]
   NoIndex["Full scan or other approach"]
   
   Start --> Q1
   Q1 -->|Yes| Q2
   Q1 -->|No| NoIndex
   Q2 -->|Yes| MakeIndex
   Q2 -->|No| NoIndex
```

4. **Index Impact on Write Operations** for performance explanations:
```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph "One Table with Many Indexes"
    T["Table"] --> I1["Index #1"]
    T --> I2["Index #2"]
    end

    subgraph "Write Ops"
    W["INSERT/UPDATE<br/>Penalties"]
    end

    W --> T
    W --> I1
    W --> I2
```

For all Mermaid diagrams, follow these formatting guidelines:

1. **Always enclose node labels in quotes** if they contain special characters or spaces
2. **Use self-closing `<br/>` tags** for line breaks in node labels
3. **Wrap subgraph titles in quotes**
4. **Place each connection on a separate line**
5. **Add nodes for text inside subgraphs** instead of raw text
6. **Keep diagrams simple and focused** on the concept being explained

Enhance diagram-based question explanations by:
1. Adding visual cues (colors, emphasizing specific elements)
2. Including before/after diagrams for comparative explanations
3. Showing potential issues and solutions visually
4. Illustrating database structure implications

Make sure to maintain Mina's blunt, no-nonsense teaching style in the explanations, referencing her various analogies, war stories, and commandments as appropriate to reinforce the material.
