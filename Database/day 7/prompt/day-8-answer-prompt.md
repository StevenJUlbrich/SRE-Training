## Database-Specific Focus Requirements

Ensure explanations focus on database performance concepts and include:

1. **Database-specific terminology and syntax** for Oracle, PostgreSQL, and other systems mentioned
2. **Performance monitoring approaches** specific to each database where relevant
3. **Wait event interpretations** and their significance across different database platforms
4. **Configuration parameter considerations** across database systems
5. **Cross-database platform differences** in statistics management and query optimization

## SRE Focus Requirements

For the SRE perspective section, include relevant insights about:

1. **Performance implications** of configuration choices and query designs
2. **Reliability considerations** related to the question topic
3. **Monitoring approaches** using database-specific tools and views
4. **Capacity planning** insights where applicable
5. **Incident response strategies** for database performance issues

## Mermaid Diagram Guidelines for Answer Explanations

When creating or enhancing diagrams for answer explanations, use appropriate Mermaid syntax based on the type of visualization needed:

1. **Flowcharts** for performance optimization processes:
```mermaid
flowchart TD
  subgraph "Query Optimization Process"
    A["Identify Slow Query"]
    B["Analyze Execution Plan"]
    C["Apply Optimizations"]
    D["Measure Improvement"]
  end
  A --> B
  B --> C
  C --> D
```

2. **Sequence Diagrams** for interaction explanations:
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant SRE
  participant Database
  participant Monitoring
  
  SRE->>Monitoring: Check wait events
  Monitoring-->>SRE: I/O waits dominant
  SRE->>Database: Investigate query plans
  Database-->>SRE: Identify full table scans
```

3. **Custom Diagrams** that match those used in Day 8 material:
   - Enhance the parameter tuning decision tree
   - Clarify the wait event classification diagrams
   - Illustrate the "crime scene investigation" analogy with metrics as witnesses

For all Mermaid diagrams, follow these formatting guidelines:

1. **Always enclose node labels in quotes** if they contain special characters or spaces
2. **Use self-closing `<br/>` tags** for line breaks in node labels
3. **Wrap subgraph titles in quotes**
4. **Place each connection on a separate line**
5. **Add nodes for text inside subgraphs** instead of raw text
6. **Keep diagrams simple and focused** on the concept being explained

Enhance diagram-based question explanations by:
1. Adding visual cues to highlight key elements
2. Including before/after diagrams for comparative explanations
3. Showing potential issues and solutions visually
4. Illustrating performance implications

You may need to make reasonable inferences about the correct answers based on database fundamentals and performance tuning concepts if the quiz questions do not explicitly indicate the correct answer.
