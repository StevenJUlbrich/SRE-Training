# Prompt: Transform Bitbucket Collaboration & Code Reviews Quiz Answer Sheet into a Comprehensive Learning Resource

I have a markdown document containing a Bitbucket Collaboration & Code Reviews Quiz Answer Sheet (Days 7-8) that requires comprehensive enhancements to become a valuable learning resource. Please transform this document by implementing ALL of the following changes:

## Format and Structure Changes

1. Create a consistent format for each Bitbucket collaboration question with the following structure:

   - **Question:** Include the full question text and all multiple choice options (A, B, C, D)
   - **Answer Overview:** 2-3 sentence summary of the correct answer
   - **Why Other Options Are Incorrect:** Brief explanation of why each wrong option is incorrect
   - **Detailed Explanation:** Comprehensive breakdown of why the answer is correct
   - **Pull Request Workflow:** Step-by-step walkthrough of the PR review and approval process
   - **Command/UI Reference:** Bitbucket interface elements and actions with screenshots where relevant
   - **Code Examples:** Sample code snippets or PR diffs showing review patterns
   - **Real-World Scenario:** Demonstrating code review best practices in a realistic team scenario
   - **Before/After Example:** Showing code state before review, during review with comments, and after addressing feedback
   - **Best Practices:** 5-6 bullet points related to effective code reviews and collaboration
   - **Common Pitfalls:** Table with columns for Pitfall, Issue, and Better Approach
   - **DevOps Perspective:** Explaining why code review skills matter in professional environments
   - **Visual Representation:** Mermaid diagram showing the pull request workflow (following the corrected approach)
   - **Key Takeaways:** 3-4 bullet points summarizing critical knowledge

2. Add horizontal rules (---) between questions for clear visual separation.

## Content Enhancement Instructions for Bitbucket Collaboration & Code Reviews

1. Create detailed explanations of the core collaboration concepts:
   - What drives the need for code reviews (quality, knowledge sharing, standards)
   - Different types of review approaches (standard PR, pair programming, over-the-shoulder)
   - Pull request components and their purpose
   - Mental model of effective team collaboration through Bitbucket

2. For EACH collaboration technique covered:
   - Show the exact Bitbucket UI elements with all common options
   - Explain what each feature does
   - Provide a complete workflow from PR creation to merge/decline
   - Show realistic UI screenshots and PR contents at each step

3. For different review approaches:
   - Compare and contrast standard PR reviews vs. pair programming
   - Show visual representations of workflow before and after each approach
   - Explain the pros and cons of each method
   - Provide decision criteria for choosing between them

4. Include visualizations of branch workflows and PR patterns for different collaboration scenarios.

5. Create cheatsheets for:
   - Code review commands/actions and their purposes
   - Preventive measures to minimize poor quality PRs
   - How to recover from problematic code reviews
   - Tools that can help with code review efficiency

## Special Elements to Add for Bitbucket Collaboration

1. Add a "Tool Comparison" section that shows different code review methods side by side:
   - Bitbucket native tools vs. external code review tools
   - Manual reviewing vs. using automated tools
   - Individual vs. team review strategies
   - Synchronous vs. asynchronous review approaches

2. For EACH collaboration scenario, add a troubleshooting section with:
   - Common issues during code reviews
   - What causes them
   - How to fix them
   - When to decline a PR and start over

3. Create visualizations for:
   - Branch workflow leading to pull requests
   - The code review process step-by-step
   - How code improves before and after review cycles
   - Review comments and their resolution within files

4. Add a "Behind the Scenes" section that explains:
   - How Bitbucket manages PRs internally
   - How the repository reflects PR state
   - The mechanics of the merge process after approval
   - How Bitbucket tracks PR activity and metrics

## Important Reminders for Mermaid Diagrams

When creating gitGraph diagrams in Mermaid:
- NEVER include `branch main` if the diagram hasn't switched away from `main` already
- Only emit `branch` command if:
  1. It's a *new branch name*, and
  2. You haven't used that branch before in the diagram
- Use descriptive commit messages to show PR states: "Opened PR", "Review requested", "Approved PR", etc.
- Add visual indicators for important events like: "Merge üîç review completed" or "PR ‚úÖ approved"
- Each diagram should accurately reflect Bitbucket's workflow while being visually clear

## General Important Reminders

- Focus heavily on building a correct mental model of how PRs and code reviews work
- Show realistic PR content examples with review comments
- Include UI screenshots at each stage of the PR workflow
- Emphasize preventive measures for quality code submissions
- ALL answers must include visual representations of the collaboration scenario
- ALL explanations should help learners understand WHY code reviews matter and HOW to conduct them effectively
- Include practical tips for team-based code review etiquette and workflows

The final document should transform basic code review explanations into a comprehensive educational resource that helps users understand not only how to participate in code reviews, but how to maximize their value, how reviews relate to team quality, and how to approach collaboration systematically in real-world scenarios.
