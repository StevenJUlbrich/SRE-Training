# SRE DEVELOPMENT PLAN

Guiding Principles
1.	Modular and Iterative Approach
  o	Maintain a clear curriculum breakdown into modules yet allow for overlapping reinforcement and iterative revisits of critical topics.
  o	Integrate more frequent checkpoints to adapt content to the cohort’s progress.
2.	Hands On and Real World Emphasis
  o	Expand practical assignments with more rigorous, industry standard projects.
  o	Incorporate case studies and mini “capstone” projects to simulate real SRE work environments.
3.	Progressive Complexity
  o	Gradually moving from fundamental topics to more complex system design, capacity planning, and resilience.
  o	Reinforce earlier lessons by building them into subsequent modules (e.g., advanced scripting tasks referencing fundamental coding).
4.	Blended Learning with Mentorship
  o	Increase mentorship opportunities by pairing advanced learners or subject matter experts with those less experienced.
  o	Encourage small study groups, where participants work together on labs and share progress in regular “stand ups.”
5.	Continuous Assessment and Feedback
  o	Include biweekly one on ones or small group review sessions in addition to quizzes and code reviews.
  o	Maintain dynamic scoring rubrics so that participants understand areas of improvement early.
6.	Relevant Industry and JPMC Alignment
  o	Expand inclusion of financial industry compliance and security considerations (common in large enterprises).
  o	Incorporate any publicly available insights into JPMorgan Chase’s SRE practices, typical interview questions, and technical environment.
7.	Focus on Communication & Soft Skills
  o	Emphasize clear documentation, presentation skills, and cross-team communication in labs, postmortems, and project reviews.
  o	Prepare participants for behavioral interview questions relevant to large enterprise contexts.

## PHASE 1: FOUNDATION (MONTHS 1–3)
Month 1: Software Engineering Fundamentals & Version Control

## WEEKS 1–2: PROGRAMMING REFRESHER

•	Data Structures & Algorithms
  o	Reinforce basics (arrays, lists, trees, graphs, searching/sorting) with an emphasis on whiteboard interview scenarios.
  o	Provide a weekly algorithmic challenge (LeetCode/HackerRank style) to build interview aptitude.
•	Object Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles
  o	Use examples aligned with typical enterprise designs (e.g., microservices, layered architecture).
  o	Emphasize how OOP ties into building scalable, maintainable solutions (important in an SRE context).
•	Basic Scripting
  o	Encourage the creation of small automation scripts (e.g., data parsing, log analysis).
  o	Provide a short project: Create a CLI tool for a basic data manipulation task.
