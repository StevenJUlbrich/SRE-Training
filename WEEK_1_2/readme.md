# Below is an overview of the **additional files** you would typically need for the Python solution to run smoothly, along with **example contents** for each file. You can freely adapt these examples to your specific project requirements

---

## 1. **CSV Files for the `filter_csv` Function**

### 1.1 `input.csv`

This file should contain column headers that match whatever you plan to filter on. For example:

```csv
ID,Name,Status
1,Alice,Active
2,Bob,Inactive
3,Charlie,Active
4,Diana,Active
5,Edward,Inactive
```

**Usage**  

- The script `filter_csv` expects:
  - an input CSV file (like `input.csv`),
  - an output CSV file (e.g., `output.csv`),
  - a column name to filter on (e.g., `Status`),
  - and a filter value (e.g., `Active`).
- Example command call within Python:

  ```python
  filter_csv('input.csv', 'output.csv', 'Status', 'Active')
  ```

- Result: The `output.csv` file will contain only those rows where `Status == "Active"`.

### 1.2 `output.csv`

After running the filter script, a new CSV file (e.g., `output.csv`) is generated. You **do not** need to create this file manually ahead of time; the script creates and populates it automatically.

---

## 2. **Log File for the `analyze_logs` Function**

### 2.1 `app.log`

This file should contain lines that occasionally include the substring `ERROR:` so the script can count occurrences. For example:

``` log
INFO: Application started
INFO: User Alice logged in
ERROR: Database connection timeout
INFO: Processing request #12345
ERROR: Failed to open file
WARN: Memory usage high
ERROR: Database connection timeout
INFO: Application shut down
```

**Usage**  

- The function `analyze_logs` looks for `ERROR:` patterns:

  ```python
  analyze_logs('app.log')
  ```

- It prints out a summary, for example:

  ```log
  Database connection timeout occurred 2 times.
  Failed to open file occurred 1 times.
  ```

---

## 3. **Optional: Requirements File**

If you plan to install dependencies automatically (as in the `setup_environment` example), it is useful to have a `requirements.txt` file (or similar) that lists your needed Python libraries. For instance:

``` pip
requests==2.31.0
```

(You can also add `regex`, `pandas`, or any additional libraries you need.)

### Usage

- Run:

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

  This installs everything required before running the scripts.

---

## 4. **Environment Configuration**

### 4.1 `.env` File (Optional)

If you prefer storing environment variables externally, you can create a `.env` file for local development. The `setup_environment` function currently just sets an environment variable in Python code; however, if you wanted to import from a `.env` file, you might have:

```env
MY_APP_MODE=development
API_TOKEN=secret_token_value
```

And you could parse this file using packages like `python-dotenv`. For instance:

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv

def setup_environment():
    load_dotenv()  # loads everything from .env
    mode = os.getenv("MY_APP_MODE", "production")
    print(f"Mode set to: {mode}")
```

---

## 5. **Directory Structure Example**

Below is a simple directory layout you could follow:

``` dir
my_sre_project/
├── main.py                # The Python script containing the logic (similar to the provided code)
├── input.csv              # Sample CSV (for filter_csv)
├── app.log                # Sample log file (for analyze_logs)
├── requirements.txt       # (Optional) listing Python dependencies
├── .env                   # (Optional) environment variable file
└── output.csv             # Generated after running filter_csv
```

**Note**:  

- You do **not** need to pre-create `output.csv`; it is generated by the script.  
- The `.env` file is optional unless you want to store environment variables outside of your code.

---

## 6. **Putting It All Together**

**Minimal Setup**  

1. **Create `input.csv`** with a few columns (including `Status`).
2. **Create `app.log`** with some lines that include `ERROR:`.
3. **Make sure you have `requests`** installed (if you use `setup_environment` or do any HTTP calls in your real project).

**Run Examples**  

1. **Filtering CSV**:  

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   and somewhere in `main.py` (or an interactive prompt), call:

   ```python
   from main import filter_csv
   filter_csv('input.csv', 'output.csv', 'Status', 'Active')
   ```

2. **Log Analysis**:  

   ```python
   from main import analyze_logs
   analyze_logs('app.log')
   ```

3. **Environment Setup**:  

   ```python
   from main import setup_environment
   setup_environment()   # Installs packages, sets environment variables
   ```

### Sample Files

Below are small sample files to get you started. Simply copy the text into files named `input.csv`, `app.log`, etc.:

#### `input.csv`

```csv
ID,Name,Status
1,Alice,Active
2,Bob,Inactive
3,Charlie,Active
4,Diana,Active
5,Edward,Inactive
```

#### `app.log`

```log
INFO: Application started
INFO: User Alice logged in
ERROR: Database connection timeout
INFO: Processing request #12345
ERROR: Failed to open file
WARN: Memory usage high
ERROR: Database connection timeout
INFO: Application shut down
```

#### `requirements.txt`

``` pip
requests==2.31.0
```

#### Adjust to include additional libraries or specific versions as needed

## Conclusion

**Files Needed**:

1. **CSV** input file(s) with appropriate headers (e.g., `input.csv`).
2. **Log file** (e.g., `app.log`) containing lines that might include `ERROR:` patterns.
3. **(Optional) `requirements.txt`** for installing dependencies like `requests`.
4. **(Optional) `.env`** file if you prefer storing environment variables externally.

With these files in place, the sample Python solution from the canvas will run smoothly. Feel free to tailor the CSV columns, log patterns, and environment setup to match your training needs or production environment. If you need further adjustments or enhancements—such as containerization (Docker), more advanced logging, or database integration—let me know!
