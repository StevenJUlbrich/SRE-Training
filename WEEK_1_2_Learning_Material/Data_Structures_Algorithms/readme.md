# Data Structures & Algorithms

This directory contains examples and exercises focused on fundamental data structures and algorithms concepts relevant to Site Reliability Engineering (SRE).

## Learning Objectives

By working through these examples and exercises, you will:

1. Understand the implementation and use of linked lists, trees, and hash maps
2. Learn common algorithms like BFS and techniques for solving problems efficiently
3. Develop skills in analyzing time and space complexity
4. Practice debugging and optimizing algorithmic solutions

## Contents

### Examples (Correctly Implemented)

- `examples/linked_list_example.py`: Implementation of a singly linked list with basic operations
- `examples/linked_list_reversal_correct.py`: Correct implementation of in-place linked list reversal
- `examples/bfs_tree_example.py`: Breadth-first search traversal of a binary tree
- `examples/two_sum_example.py`: Efficient solution to the two-sum problem

### Flawed Implementations (For Review)

- `linked_list_flawed.py`: Contains common errors in linked list implementation
- `bfs_tree_flawed.py`: Contains errors in breadth-first search implementation
- `two_sum_flawed.py`: Inefficient or incorrect implementation of the two-sum problem

### Quizzes

- `quizzes/dsa_quiz.md`: Quiz questions on data structures and algorithms concepts

## Instructions

1. Start by reviewing the correctly implemented examples to understand the concepts
2. Then, examine the flawed implementations to identify and fix the issues
   - Look for bugs, inefficiencies, and logical errors
   - The flawed implementations contain comments highlighting areas to focus on
3. After fixing the flawed implementations, compare your solutions with the correct implementations
4. Test your understanding by completing the quiz

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python knowledge
