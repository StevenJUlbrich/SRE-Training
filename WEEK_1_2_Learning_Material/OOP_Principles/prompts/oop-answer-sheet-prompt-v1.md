Prompt: Transform my Object-Oriented Programming Quiz into a Comprehensive Educational Resource
I have a markdown document containing an Object-Oriented Programming Quiz Answer Sheet that requires comprehensive readability improvements. Please transform this document into an enhanced educational resource by implementing ALL of the following changes:
Format and Structure Changes

Create a detailed, clickable table of contents at the top with direct links to all sections and subsections.
Add consistent section headers with the following format:

Main sections: ## [Section Name]
Subsections: ### [Question Number]: [Question Topic]
Each question must be formatted in a consistent, visually distinct way


Insert horizontal rules (---) between all major sections for clear visual separation.
For EVERY question section, structure it exactly as follows:

Question text in blockquote format
"Answer Overview" - 2-3 sentence summary
"Detailed Answer" - full explanation broken into paragraphs with headings
"OOP Principle Analysis" - clear explanation of relevant OOP principles
"Example Code" (where applicable) with proper syntax highlighting and detailed comments
"Example Output" - MUST include a concrete example showing what running the code would produce, with realistic sample data
"Testing Approach" - bullet points showing how to test the solution with at least 3 test scenarios
"SRE Perspective" - explaining why this concept matters for reliability and real-world applications
"Best Practices" - MUST be included for EVERY question, formatted with heading and 5-6 bullet points
"Common Pitfalls" - formatted as a table with columns for Pitfall, Issue, and Better Approach
"Advanced Considerations" - bullet points of more complex aspects
"Visual Explanation" - mermaid diagram where helpful (especially for OOP relationships and patterns)
"Key Takeaways" - bullet list of 4-5 critical points



Content Enhancement Instructions

Break up ALL long paragraphs into shorter ones (maximum 3-4 sentences per paragraph).
Create comparison tables for ANY concepts that can be compared side-by-side (especially for inheritance vs. composition, design patterns, etc.).
Convert ALL lists in the original document to proper markdown bullet or numbered lists.
For ALL code examples:

Add more detailed inline comments
Ensure proper syntax highlighting by using ```python tags
Include concrete, realistic example inputs/outputs - ALWAYS show sample output
Break up any functions longer than 30 lines


Format all key terms, OOP principles, design patterns, and class names in bold throughout the document.
Add a detailed glossary section at the end with definitions for at least 15 technical terms used in the document.
Create a strong conclusion section that summarizes the key principles across all sections.

Special Elements to Add

For ANY section discussing multiple OOP principles or patterns, create a comparison table with columns for Purpose, Key Characteristics, and Typical Usage Scenarios.
For ALL principles or patterns, explicitly label the "Best Practices" subsection with a heading #### Best Practices and include 5-6 bullet points.
Add boxes labeled "Example Usage:" before ALL code examples to make them stand out, and ALWAYS include concrete example output showing the result of running the code with specific inputs.
For EVERY OOP principle, pattern, or relationship, include a mermaid flowchart or class diagram to visualize the concept.
For complex class relationships (inheritance, composition, etc.), ensure the mermaid diagrams clearly show the relationships between classes.

Important Reminders

ALL sections must have a "Best Practices" subsection with consistent formatting
ALL code examples must show concrete example outputs with realistic data
Do not skip ANY of these requirements for ANY question
Use consistent formatting throughout the entire document
If any element seems to be missing or incomplete, add it rather than leaving it out
Ensure the "SRE Perspective" sections relate OOP principles and patterns to real-world reliability engineering scenarios

The final document should be thorough, consistent in structure, visually appealing, and optimized for both learning and practical reference. Make it a true educational resource that someone could use to master these Object-Oriented Programming concepts while understanding their practical applications.
This prompt follows the same structure and approach as the DSA prompt but has been tailored specifically for the OOP content. It should produce a similarly comprehensive educational resource with consistent formatting and enhanced content.
