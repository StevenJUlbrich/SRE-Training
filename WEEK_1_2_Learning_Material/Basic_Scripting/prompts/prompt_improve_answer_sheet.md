Document Enhancement Prompt
I have a technical markdown document about scripting concepts for SREs (Site Reliability Engineers). While the content is comprehensive and well-structured, I'd like to improve its readability and educational value. Please enhance the document by:

Adding a detailed table of contents with links to all major sections and subsections.
Improving the visual hierarchy by:

Adding more whitespace between major sections
Using consistent formatting for headings and subheadings
Adding horizontal rules to separate major sections


Enhancing code examples by:

Adding more detailed comments
Including example inputs and outputs where appropriate
Using consistent formatting and indentation
Breaking longer code blocks into smaller, focused examples when possible


Optimizing text content by:

Breaking long paragraphs into shorter ones
Converting lists to bullet points for better scannability
Using bold text for key terms and important concepts
Adding summary boxes or "key takeaways" after complex sections


Adding visual elements like:

Comparison tables for concepts that need side-by-side evaluation
Flow charts or diagrams to illustrate processes
Ensuring diagrams have clear labels and connections


Supplementing with educational aids such as:

Example outputs for code snippets
"Best Practices" sections after each major topic
A glossary of technical terms at the end of the document


Standardizing the structure of each answer section to include:

Question text
Answer overview (brief summary)
Detailed explanation
Code examples with comments
SRE perspective on the concept
Common pitfalls
Visual explanations where helpful
Key takeaways


Adding a conclusion that ties together the key principles across all sections.

Please maintain the technical accuracy of all content while making these readability improvements. The goal is to create a document that serves as both a reference and a learning resource for those who want to understand scripting concepts "brick by brick."RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.
