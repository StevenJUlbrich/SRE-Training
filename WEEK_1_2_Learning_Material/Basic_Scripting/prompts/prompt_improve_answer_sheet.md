Here's a precise, complete prompt you can use with exact instructions on how to transform the document:

# Prompt: Transform my SRE Scripting Documentation Into a Highly Readable Educational Resource

I have a markdown document containing an SRE Scripting Quiz Answer Sheet that needs comprehensive readability improvements. Please take this document and transform it into an enhanced educational resource by implementing ALL of the following changes:

## Format and Structure Changes

1. Create a detailed, clickable table of contents at the top with direct links to all sections and subsections.

2. Add consistent section headers with the following format:
   - Main sections: `## [Section Name]`
   - Subsections: `### [Question Number]: [Question Topic]`
   - Each question should be formatted in a consistent, visually distinct way

3. Insert horizontal rules (---) between all major sections for clear visual separation.

4. For EVERY question section, structure it exactly as follows:
   - Question text in blockquote format
   - "Answer Overview" - 2-3 sentence summary
   - "Detailed Answer" - full explanation broken into paragraphs with headings
   - "Example Code" (where applicable) with proper syntax highlighting
   - "Example Output" showing what running the code would produce
   - "SRE Perspective" - explaining why this concept matters for reliability
   - "Common Pitfalls" - formatted as a table with columns for Pitfall, Issue, and Better Approach
   - "Advanced Considerations" - bullet points of more complex aspects
   - "Visual Explanation" - mermaid diagram where helpful
   - "Key Takeaways" - bullet list of 4-5 critical points

## Content Enhancement Instructions

1. Break up ALL long paragraphs into shorter ones (maximum 3-4 sentences per paragraph).

2. Create comparison tables for ANY concepts that can be compared side-by-side.

3. Convert ALL lists in the original document to proper markdown bullet or numbered lists.

4. For ALL code examples:
   - Add more detailed inline comments
   - Ensure proper syntax highlighting by using ```python tags
   - Include example inputs/outputs where missing
   - Break up any functions longer than 30 lines

5. Format all key terms in bold throughout the document.

6. Add a detailed glossary section at the end with definitions for at least 15 technical terms used in the document.

7. Create a strong conclusion section that summarizes the key principles across all sections.

## Special Elements to Add

1. For ANY section discussing multiple methods or approaches, create a comparison table.

2. For ALL sections discussing tools or commands, add a "Best Practices" subsection with 5-6 bullet points.

3. Add boxes labeled "Example Usage:" before ALL code examples to make them stand out.

4. For ANY process-oriented topic, include a mermaid flowchart to visualize the process.

5. Add a "Testing Approach" section after EVERY code implementation showing how to test the solution.

Do not skip any of these instructions - implement ALL of them to create a comprehensive educational document that would be extremely valuable to someone learning these concepts step by step. The final document should be thorough, consistent in structure, visually appealing, and optimized for both learning and reference.
