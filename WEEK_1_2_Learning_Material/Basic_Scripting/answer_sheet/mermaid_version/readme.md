This folder contains the original version ('basic_scripting_answer_sheet.md') of a Markdown file that included Mermaid diagrams.

The file was moved here because Mermaid diagrams may not render correctly in all Markdown viewers or platforms (e.g., Bitbucket).

A converted version of the file, with Mermaid diagrams rendered as images ('PNG'), should be located in the parent directory ('D:\Development_Personal\SRE-Training\WEEK_1_2_Learning_Material\Basic_Scripting\answer_sheet') with the name 'basic_scripting_answer_sheet-png.md'.
